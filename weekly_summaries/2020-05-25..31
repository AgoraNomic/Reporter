# Summary

Welcome back, ATMunn!

This week, R. Lee is keeping things fun with a proposed Flappy Bird
tournament and a proposal bribing voters with black ribbons in return
for victory.

As usual, there were a variety of interesting rules questions. grok
tried to transfer some "shinies", and G. filled in the missing
definition with a currency under eir own control. There was some
discussion about whether people should try to follow the rules at all.

Proposals: nch continued to revise eir draft for a "Sets" economy. In
the meantime, many proposals were up for voting this week, including a
new office of Webmastor the return of Promises, and a new process for
high crimes. New proposals under discussion include doing away with
auction definitions, and handling zombies with assets ("talismans")
instead of switches.

Agora's academic and cultural traditions continue. P.S.S. and nch ask
for feedback on their thesis topics; long service awards are awarded;
and a proposal is submitted to award the 2016 Silver Quill.

# Games

* nch submits updated versions of eir "Sets" economy proposal

  * The first thread turns into a discussion about the extra work
    created for the Promotor by proposals submitted after e circulates
    eir draft distribution. This in turn leads to a proposed contract,
    "LoAFER", for Agorans to try to help officers keep accurate records.

  * E also circulates a draft extension that would allow any three cards
    to be transmuted to one of any kind.

  * Aris points out a minor scam the Assessor could pull off; nch
    decides to the bug there for now and fix it later.

* R. Lee submits a proposal in which e would win and anyone who voted
  FOR would get a black ribbon. Thread: "Proposal Bribery"

* R. Lee proposes a Flappy Bird tournament.


# Culture and History

* Aris's proposed reform of Agora's degree system is discussed in the
  thread "[Proto] College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences".

* nch circulates a draft of a thesis about past Agoran economies, asking
  what kind of information people want, leading to some discussion.
  Thread: "Thesis Snippet"

  * G. gives some historical information about Stems and election
    platforms.

  * Discussion branches into date formates and the value of
    idiosyncrasy.

* P.S.S. is working on a thesis and asks for thoughts on "technical
  domains of control". Discussion includes blockchains and rewriting
  email timestamps.

* Patent titles:

  * The Herald submits a proposal to award the 2016 Silver Quill to
    ais523 for Proposal 7811, "Winning by apathy".

    * This follows general discussion of back-awarding Silver Quills for
      missing years, in which G. recommends Proposal 7811.

    * In the same discussion, G. also mentions Proposal 7831, a justice
      system many pieces of which remain in the rules. There is some
      discussion about bringing back parts of the old justice system
      based on Cards.

  * The Herald awards Long Service Awards to Jason (twice), Aris and
    Falsifian, concluding the process started last week.

* There are questions about the names given to different win types in
  the Herald's monthly report, and the possibility of adding more
  detail, in thread "[Herald] The Scroll of Agora".


# Auctions and zombies

* R. Lee objects to ratifying that the May zombie auction worked as
  intended.

* G. proposes to do away with detailed auction rules, and have mechanism
  determined by the person running the auction together with regulations
  promulgated by the Treasuror.

* Cuddle Beam destroys the Chattelbeam contract which made em a
  superzombie and through which e and twg won the game earlier. Thread:
  "humble agoran farmer closes shop (for now) [Attn. Notary]"


# Miscellaneous

* R. Lee points eir finger a couple of times and learns that twg did in
  fact cause Cuddle Beam to win. Thread: "TWG fingered"

* ATMunn rejoins the game, flipping eir Master switch to emself.

* The Tailor awards a gray ribbon to BÃ¶gtil.

* grok purports to transfer "shinies" in the thread "CFJ 3837 Assigned
  to grok", prompting CFJ 3838 about whether e actually transferred
  coins, since shinies are no longer defined. G. creates a contract
  defining "shinies" as a currency entirely under eir own control.


# Other proposals

* Aris submits an updated version of eir proposal to bring back
  Promises. (E sent a draft to the discussion list on May 17.)

* P.S.S. submits a version of eir High Crimes and Treason proposal
  discussed last week.

* Discussion continues on Jason's "Talismans" zombie ownership proposal.

* Jason proposes a small adjustment to the definition of private assets.

* P.S.S. proposes an official process for attaching Concurring or
  Dissenting opinions to CFJ judgements. Thread: "Draft Proposal:
  External Opinions"

* Murphy proposes to replace the Line-item Veto rule with a shorter
  provision that would give the power to the Prime Minister, eliminating
  an office, meaning less work for em as ADoP.


# Other questions

* There is discussion about whether people should avoid breaking the
  rules at all times time, or only when the (social or legal) punishment
  outweighs the benefit. The problem of deciding fair fixes, and a
  historical solution called Equity for it, is mentioned. Thread:
  "Back-Awarding of Silver Quills"

* CFJ 3831 is remitted. The Arbitor composes eir own arguments
  explaining, for the next judge, the reason why it was mooted.

* Should a CFJ entangling facts normally irrelevant to the game with
  facts relevant to the game be judged IRRELEVANT? CFJ 3837 is asssigned
  to grok and arguments are submitted.


# The Dragon Corporation

Threads generally have "Dragon" in the subject line.

* Aris becomes the president by owning the most shares.
