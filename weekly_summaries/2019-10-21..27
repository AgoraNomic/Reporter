    From: Kerim Aydin <kerim at u.washington.edu>
    Subject: "BUS: Proto: The gig economy"
    Date:  Wed Apr 19 13:33:38 UTC 2017

    (Some jobs don't need regular Offices, but should be rewarded with payoffs
    as they are valuable to Agora).

    Proto:  The Gig Economy

    Create the following Rule, The Gig Economy:

          If a task is defined by the rules as a Gig, then any Player
          (the performer) CAN perform the task (perform the gig) if no 
          one has performed the task in the same Nomic Week.     

          If a performer does so, clearly specifying that eir action is 
          intended to fulfill a particular gig,  Agora SHALL pay that 
          player 5 shinies at the beginning of the next Nomic Week.  

          If a player purports to perform a gig, then any player CAN, with 
          2 Support, assert that it was a failed gig; if this occurs, the
          performer is not paid.  This SHOULD only be asserted if the 
          attempted performance clearly falls short of the required effort.

          The following Gigs are defined:

          - Reporter:  Publish a report, at least 300 words in length, with
            a description of events that have happened in Agora in the last
            2 months that the Reporter believes significant or interesting.
            This may contain editorialization or other pieces of Agora-related
            information, as long as it is neither i) factually incorrect nor 
            ii) disrespectful to any person or Agora itself.  The goal of such 
            reports is to create a more informed population. 

          - Research Assistant: Publish a report, at least 300 words in length,
            in response to a request for information about the history of Agora.  

          - Tour Guide:  Publish (including updating) a precis of Rules, a set 
            of resources such as web links, or information that might serve as
            an entry in an Agoran FAQ.

          - Bard: Publish, or publish a link to, a substantially creative and 
            original Work of Art created by the Bard, relevant to and created
            for Agora, with the goal of evoking enlightenment, humor, entertainment,
            challenging ideas, or thoughtful contemplation in Agorans.

         [Option:  a single Officer, the Managor, whose job it is to promote the
          gig economy, track gigs (monthly report), and maintain an online archive
          of gig-produced material].
