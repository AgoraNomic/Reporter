In progress.


# Proposals

* Aris proposes an improvement to the definition of uncontested
  elections. Thread: "[Proposal] Elections Aren't Over Till They End"

* Jason resubmits a proposal that failed on a technicality, that would
  ban zombies from holding office. Thread: "[proposal] 8228 retry"

* Falsifian drafts a couple of possible changes to address the bug with
  pledges in the thread "Pledge Bug".

* Aris circulates a draft of a proposal for budgets and taxation, which
  could be combined with making rewards and paydays come out of budgets
  instead of being created on demand. There is some discussion of
  possibilities for Agoran economics.

* nch proposes to make "by announcement" implicit, so rules don't need
  to say it. Thread: "[Proposal] No More 'By Announcement'"


# Miscellaneous

* CFJ 3831 is entered into Moot (with 5 support, after time ran out for
  doing it with 4 support). Thread: "Moot Attempt"

* There's some fuss about karma, and Trigon is no longer interetsed in
  judging, in thread "[Proposal] Elections Aren't Over Till They End".
