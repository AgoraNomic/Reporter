In progress.


# New registrations

* grok, who last played in 2017, re-registers and expresses interest in
  judging cases. G. refers to em as the judge of the excellent CFJ 3514.

* New player BÃ¶gtil registers.


# Voting

* Proposals 8377-8387 are resolved. Adopted proposals:

  * 8377: Adjustments to the justice system: change the burden of proof,
    and rename a couple of rules.

  * 8379: Expand the conditions for winning by paradox.

  * 8381: Award R. Lee the Patent Title of Money Launderer.

  * 8386: Close a loophole for judges.

* The Promotor points out the distribution of Proposal 8387 got somewhat
  close to being self-ratified.


# Culture

* The Herald announces intent to award "Long Service Award" patent
  titles, after receiving a list of long-term office holders from the
  ADoP. Threads: "[Herald] Petition of the Associate Director of
  Personnel", "[Herald, attn: PM, Speaker] Long Service Awards"

petitions the ADoP to recommend candidate recipients of
  Long Service Awards, and the ADoP responds with a list of long-term
  office-holders.


# Auctions and zombies

* G. notices that auctions are broken because all auctions end
  immediately. Thread: "Do all auctions end immediately?"

  * Aris says it has been noticed before.

  * grok proposes an interim fix while G. works on a larger auction
    overhaul. Thread: "[Proposal] Auction End Clarification"

  * Falsifian announces intent to ratify without objection that the May
    zombie auction didn't before the first bid. Thread: "May Auction
    Ratification"

* G. circulates some draft text for overhauling how auctions work, since
  there have been many problems with them. Partial credit to earlier
  language by Alexis. Thread: "Auction overhaul first cut"

  * There's a side discussion about auctioning off switch states, since
    zombie ownership is currently represented by switches. ais523
    suggests allowing Agora to create Promises.

    * G. drafts a proposal for relating assets to switches. Thread:
      "keys".

* Jason circulates draft text for handling zombie ownership with assets
  instead of switches, which could simplify zombie auctions. The assets
  are called talismans, after a contract Warrigal created earlier.
  Thread: "[proto] Talismans"


# Rules questions

* Jason judges CFJ 3833; e circulated a draft last week.

* Can Aris refer a proposal to a chamber using those words? P.S.S.
  proposes to just add the definition to the rules.

* G. submits a proposal that attempts to create a contract. Thread:
  "Protos: Referral and High Crimes"

* Murphy judges CFJ 3836 true: a CFJ R. Lee called would make em
  eligible to win by paradox if it had a judgement of PARADOXICAL
  assigned to it for seven days.


# Other Proposals

* Aris proposes an improvement to the definition of uncontested
  elections. Thread: "[Proposal] Elections Aren't Over Till They End"

* Jason resubmits a proposal that failed on a technicality, that would
  ban zombies from holding office. Thread: "[proposal] 8228 retry"

* Falsifian drafts a couple of possible changes to address the bug with
  pledges in the thread "Pledge Bug".

* Aris circulates a draft of a proposal for budgets and taxation, which
  could be combined with making rewards and paydays come out of budgets
  instead of being created on demand. There is some discussion of
  possibilities for Agoran economics.

* nch proposes to make "by announcement" implicit, so rules don't need
  to say it. Past conversations and Proposal 7928 ("no we can't", G.,
  adopted in October 2017) are mentioned. Thread: "[Proposal] No More
  'By Announcement'"

* Discussion of the relative desirability of the names "Registror" and
  "Notory", and an old meaning of the latter. Thread: "Renaming
  Sillyness (At AI 3, of course)"

* G. proposes a simplified replacement to the Moot process for CFJs.
  Thread: "[Proposal] Mooting moots"

* nch circulates more versions of eir proposal "Sets" for an economy with
  different kinds of cards that can be converted to corresponding useful
  assets. Threads have "Sets" in the subject line.

  * One concern is to make sure it doesn't accidentally become
    impossible to submit proposals (but for R1698).

  * nch's proposal includes auctions of the Lost and Found Department's
    possessions. There's concern this could lead to problems.

  * nch withdraws their latest version of the proposal for now while
    discussion continues. A tricky part to fix is the VP auction.

* P.S.S. circulates a draft proposal based on eir "Treason" idea from
  last week. Lots of discussion .Thread: "Protos: Referral and High
  Crimes"

* grok proposes to close a loophole where a Writ of FAGE can allow a
  player to skip the 30-day window between deregistering and
  reregistering. ais523 is quoted appealing to keep the loophole open
  after last year's scam. Thread: "[Proposal] Cantus Counterscam"

* G. proposes to define WILL as a shorthand combining "CAN once by
  announcement" with "SHALL", leading to much debate. Thread: "Agora
  willing"

  * G. funds a contest for finding a concise definition of WILL. Thread:
    "[Contest: Rule Golf] Re: Agora willing"

  * As an alternative, Murphy proposes that "CAN and SHALL" implicitly
    include "by announcement" as a default method.

* Jason proposes to repeal Rule 2599, which defined Editorial
  Guidelines, and which e wrote. Thread: "[proposal] RIP the editor"

* R. Lee proposes to repeal twg's "Temporary CFJ Setup", Rule 2609, twg
  having had two months and not used it, and also G.'s Rule 2597,
  "Line-item Veto", which has been around for over a year without doing
  much, though G. has called in the past for it to be kept. Thread:
  "Short Proposal"


# Contracts

* Falsifian finds a bug in the Presedential Elections proposal for the
  Dragon Corporation. Jason asks whether the proposal would allow
  deputisation as President. Thread: "[Dragon] Presidential Elections
  and Shorter Voting Periods"


# Miscellaneous

* CFJ 3831 is entered into Moot (with 5 support, after time ran out for
  doing it with 4 support), and the decision to determine public
  confidence in the decision begins. Threads: "Moot Attempt", "[Arbitor]
  CFJ 3831 enters the mootiest moot ever"

* There's some fuss about karma, and Trigon is no longer interetsed in
  judging, in thread "[Proposal] Elections Aren't Over Till They End".

* Discussion continues on using Agora's rules or judicial system for
  things not directly relevant to Agora. Thread: "coherent vision for
  Agora Nomic as an independent policing/judiciary force"

* R. Lee is punished for violating eir pledge to top-post at most five
  times over a million-year period. Thread: "It hasn't been 1 million
  years yet"


# History

* G. recalls that a coin-destroying proposal was associated with the
  scam that created the Town Fountain. Thread: "Protos: Referral and
  High Crimes"
