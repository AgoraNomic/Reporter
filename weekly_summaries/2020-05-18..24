In progress.


# Proposals

* Aris proposes an improvement to the definition of uncontested
  elections. Thread: "[Proposal] Elections Aren't Over Till They End"

* Jason resubmits a proposal that failed on a technicality, that would
  ban zombies from holding office. Thread: "[proposal] 8228 retry"

* Falsifian drafts a couple of possible changes to address the bug with
  pledges in the thread "Pledge Bug".

* Aris circulates a draft of a proposal for budgets and taxation, which
  could be combined with making rewards and paydays come out of budgets
  instead of being created on demand.


# Miscellaneous

* R. Lee's attempt to enter CFJ 3831 into moot did not get enough
  support in time, so Falsifian announces new intents with higher
  support. Thread: "Moot Attempt"

* There's some fuss about karma, and Trigon is no longer interetsed in
  judging, in thread "[Proposal] Elections Aren't Over Till They End".
