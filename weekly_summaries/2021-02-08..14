# Summary

G.'s era of dictatorly mischief is finally unambiguously at an end,
with eir Emergency Regulations repealed by proposal if they weren't
already. The new era is marked by the election of our new Prime
Minister: all hail Trigon!

This week also saw the rollback of the Bodies of Law framework and a
reworked Extra Votes mechanism.

Mysterious "Bunny"'s identity revealed: it's ATMunn!

An idea circulated this week: reward clever tournament regulation
authors by encouraging turning them into theses.

Cuddlebeam tries out nix's class-0 oathbreaking idea from last week.
Let's indict em! More originally, Cuddlebeam also tries to make a
contract with no parties.


# Voting

* Voting ends on Proposals 8538-8540. All three are adopted.

  * Repeal all emergency regulations. See the "Dictatorship" section
    last week for context. (8538)

  * Roll back the Bodies of Law framework. (8539)

  * Make Extra Votes stronger. (8540)

* Trigon is elected Prime Minister.


# Miscellanous

* Jason proposes to redistribute Doubloons evenly in the Pirate
  contract.

* The "Guess That Agoran!" game continues until Aris correctly guesses
  it's ATMunn.

* It's Falsifian's birthday, but birthday rewards are still broken.

* Falsifian proposes an amendment to the Agoran Press contract.


# Proposals

* G. suggests adding rule text encouraging turning tournament
  regulations into theses.

* Jason proposes to make unused Stones more likely to escape. (E
  submitted then withdrew a version last week.)


# Dictatorship

* G. explains what eir plan last week was: "My plan had been to
  uncertainty-entangle aspects of the gamestate...". Thread: "Dictator
  Dethronement"


# Rule questions

* Cuddlebeam deliberately makes and breaks a pledge with a crime value
  of 0. (nix already did this last week.) Jason suggests indicting em.

* Cuddlebeam tries to makes a contract that persists even with no
  parties. Thread: "humble agoran farmer creates Pinocchio"

* Would the proposal "Destroy Agora." be blocked by Rule 1698, or would
  something else block it instead? Something else: G. judges CFJ 3896
  FALSE. Related: Contracts v8 indeed took effect (CFJ 3897 FALSE).


# Auctions

  stones are auctioned.

* The February victory auction ends. Falsifian wins with a bid of 300
