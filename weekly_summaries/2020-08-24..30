# Summary

This week, G. and nix begin a collusion to increase the power of G.'s
Rulebending rule to 3. What will they do with it? And what is the
meaning of G.'s proposal text "Normal service will resume shortly"?

In more interesting setup for next week: Gaelan announces intent to
begin eir "Nomaoic" tournament, in which proposal texts are secret.

Nathan attempts to make infinitely transfers happen in an instant.

ATMunn announces intent to impeach every officer.

As a reminder, I (Falsifian) will be taking every other week off from
reporting. I encourage others to join the Agoran Press contract and
claim the occasional week!


# Rulebending scam

* G. and nix collude to increase the power of G.'s Rulebending rule to
  3: G. writes the proposal (8493) and nix uses eir power as Prime
  Minister to distribute the proposal. What do they have planned? Thread
  "(proposal)"

  * A bit of context: G.'s Rulebending rule was enacted at power 1
    through normal voting channels (but with incentive to vote FOR). It
    gives G. specifically the power to decide who gets to use it.

  * G. earlier submits a proposal with the text "Normal service will
    resume shortly.", and pends it in the thread in which e submits eir
    power 3 proposal. What does it mean, and is it related to the scam?

  * Gaelan submits proposals to repeal the Rulebending rules, which the
    Promotor promptly distributes.


# Voting

* Proposals 8488 and 8489 do not get a quorum of voters, and the
  Assessor doesn't send the humiliating reminder in time. Thread:
  "[Assessor] Humiliating Public Reminder for Proposals 8488-8489"

  * The assessor proposes to shorten the deadline for em to issue
    humiliating public reminders. Thread: "[Proposal] Timely reminders"

* The decisions on adopting Proposals 8490-8492 are resolved. Adopted:

  * Make sure Emergency Regulations are actually taking effect. (8490)

  * Remove the language about scope from Ratification Without Objection.
    (Some ratification may have been failing due to lack of specified
    scope.) (8492)

* Proposals 8493-8495 are covered in the previous section, "Rulebending
  scam". (Note added later: the Promotor later noticed there were two Proposals
  8495; as of 2020-09-15, the one related to the Rulebending scam is
  tentatively to be renumbered to 8498.)


# Rule questions, miscellaneous scams, etc.

* Under the Treasuror's auction regulations, when exactly does a player
  need to be "funded" in order for eir bid to count? The Registrar
  thinks it's at the end of the auction (and so Cuddlebeam doesn't get a
  zombie).  Thread: "humble agoran farmer gets a zombie"

* Aris creates a contract giving 10 Coins to the first player to file a
  "proof of claim of a valid judgement". ATMunn and G. both claim to
  satisfy the terms, but ATMunn doesn't include any actual proof,
  leading to a CFJ. Threads: "[Contract] Proofs of Claim", "[cfj] on
  proofs of claim"; CFJs 3881 and 3882.

* Nathan does an experiment involving infinitely many asset transfers
  happening with no time passing. G. links some relevant CFJs. Threads
  have "Supertask" in the subject line.

* Trigon sends "This is a CFJ." as a message. Is it? Thread: "yes"

* Can multiple ribbons be awarded to persons in the same body? Jason
  finds the answer is no, in eir judgements of CFJs 3877 and 3878.

  hidden proposal text, after some discussion about what's likely
  to happen. Threads: "Proto-tournament: Nomaoic", "Intent to Begin
  Nomaoic"

  Threads: "[Contract] The Splat Market", "[Splat Market] Order Book"
