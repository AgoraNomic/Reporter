    Dark Arts"

  cost coins. Thread: "Protos: Coins have Value"

  on arguments e made in the thread P.S.S. started. Lots of

# Ideas

* Dave suggests getting Agora involved with contracts and behaviour
  outside Agora's usual domain, leading to some discussion. Thread:
  "coherent vision for Agora Nomic as an independent policing/judiciary
  force"


# Rules questions and bugs

* Does writing actions on lines starting with "> " make them fail?
  Probably not necessarily. Thread: "[Registrar] May Zombie Auction"

* Is Aris's definition of "to refer a proposal to a chamber" now
  understood in a generic Agoran context? Aris calls CFJ 3834 in thread
  "[Promotor] Ministerial Referrals", but R. Lee judges it on a
  technicality.

* When does specifying invalid parameters cause proposal submission to
  fail? Jason drafts a judgement for CFJ 3833.

* Can R. Lee get a paradox victory out of eir coin CFJ? E tries, calling
  CFJ 3835 in the thread "more paradox CFJs". The Arbitor judges it
  IRRELEVANT, citing the responsibility of eir office to administer
  justice in a fair manner.

* Does a pledge to perform an action cease to exist before its maker can
  become guilty of not honouring it? R. Lee asks in the thread "Pledge
  Bug". It also comes up in the thread "[proposal] Prior violations".


# Miscellaneous

* The May zombie auction ends. Jason gets eir last bid in just under the
  wire. Threads: "[Registrar] May zombie auction status", "[Registrar]
  End of May zombie auction"

* Trigon appreciates Aris's draft Promotor reports. Thread: "[Promotor]
  Draft".

* Cuddle Beam claims Agora is ossified, but nch points out an error in
  eir reasoning. Thread: "Agora is currently ossified (but it's OK
  (kinda))"

* Aris starts a discussion on what happened to the MUD, and there's some
  talk of organizing a time to meet there. Thread: "MUD Post Mortem".

* Three players join the Dragon Corporation. Aris proposes amendments to
  make the office of President elected and to make the voting periods
  shorter. Falsifian becomes president after buying the most shares.
  Threads have "Dragon" in the subject line.

* R. Lee announces intent to enter CFJ 3831 into moot. CFJ 3831 is about
  whether Murphy's Notice of Honour with "-1 kudo" and "+1 kudo" worked.
  There is discussion of the moot process and talk of bringing back an
  appeals process. "Moot Attempt"
