# Summary

Last Week in Agora is back to report on an Agora abuzz with activity.

This week, Cuddle Beam appeals to Agorans to keep better historical
records. Fortunately, much our history is still in living memory, and G.
recounts some tales from the past. Continuing our traditions to mark the
passage of time, the final Patent Titles for 2019 from Awards Month are
awarded.

Agorans continue trying to be clever. R. Lee tries hard to get a paradox
victory out of the proposal "A Coin Award" but fails. A variety of
clever proposals are circulated, including a promising new economy, a
new crime of Treason, and discussion of having a Webmastor or a
Reportor. Dave, one of our Watchers, suggests that Agora could get real.
The usual varity of rules questions are raised, and a decision that
seemed settled may be entered into moot.

Possible up-and-comings to keep an eye out for: the rise of the Dragon
Corporation (after nearly becoming ashes), and talk of a rejuvination of
the Agoran MUD. Buy some shares of DRGN, and help us pick a time to meet
in the MUD!

Zombie auctions are finally working again.

And as always, don't forget to vote! Proposals 8377-8387 are being decided.


# Voting and elections

* Voting begins on proposals 8377-8387, including:

  * Adjustments to the justice system. (8377, 8378)

  * Proposals related to R. Lee's attempted win by paradox. (8379, 8380,
    8381)

  * Criminalizing harming Agora (8384 and 8387, except 8387 wasn't
    successfully distributed)

  * Miscellaneous: The Webmastor (8382); Table tennis (8383); destroying
    the Dragon Corporation (8385); closing a judicial loophole (8386).

* Publius Scribonius Scholasticus becomes the only candidate for Herald
  and is elected. (The previous Herald, Alexis, deregistered on May 3.)


# Culture

* Two of the Awards Month titles are awarded, both to Falsifian:
  Employee of the Year (thread: "[ADoP] Cracking rocks") and 2019 Wooden
  Gavel (thread: "[Arbitor] Wood Gavel award"). (The Silver Quill was
  awarded to G. on April 27. The Golden Glove doesn't seem to have
  happened this year.)


# History

* Cuddle Beam starts a discussion on how Agora could keep a better
  record of its history, with comparison to Blognomic. Thread: "Research
  Request: Economics"

* G. gives history lessons on the threads "Protos: Coins have
  Value", "Proto: Sets" and "crimes and infractions".


# Proposals

* nch proposes a new office, the Webmastor. (Draft circulated last
  week.) There's some discussion about maintaining the website.

* Trigon proposes requiring the first two public messages each day to
  begin with "ping" and "pong", respectively. Thread: "[attn Promotor]
  Ping!"

* Discussion continues from last week on the Reportor role and
  alternatives to making it an office. Thread: "Protos: Two Small
  Offices"

* Outlawing harm to Agora:

  * P.S.S. proposes outlawing actions that would ossify Agora if it were
    not for Rule 1698. Thread: "[Attn: Rulekeepor, Promotor] Proposal
    and Cleanings"

  * Aris proposes an alternative in thread "[Proto] Defense Against the
    Dark Arts"

  * G. proposes another alternative, leading to further discussion.
    Subject line starts as "[Promotor] Distribution of Proposals
    8377-8387" and changes to "Treason".

* P.S.S. circulates some draft proposals that would make some things
  cost coins. Thread: "Protos: Coins have Value"

* nch circulates an economy idea based around four new assets, based
  on arguments e made in the thread P.S.S. started. Lots of
  discussion. Thread: "Proto: Sets"

  * G. drafts a possible side-game to go with it. Thread: "a side-game
    for sets".

* Jason proposes to retire the Dragon Corporation. Subject: "[Notary]
  Weekly Nonsense (Report) [attn Promotor]". Instead, e and a couple of
  others end up reviving it.

* G. proposes to remove some old protections against abuse of Referee
  power. Thrad: "[proposal] no-longer needed protection"

* R. Lee proposes to rename the offices of Registrar and Notary to
  Registror and Notory. Thread: "Renaming Sillyness (At AI 3, of
  course)"

* Aris circulates a draft proposal to bring back an old Agoran system of
  promises.

* Jason proposes to make penalties for breaking the rules depend on the
  rules at the time the violation occurred. Thread: "[proposal] Prior
  violations"


# Ideas

* Dave (a Watcher) suggests getting Agora involved with contracts and
  behaviour outside Agora's usual domain, leading to some discussion.
  Thread: "coherent vision for Agora Nomic as an independent
  policing/judiciary force"


# Rules questions and bugs

* Does writing actions on lines starting with "> " make them fail?
  Probably not necessarily. Thread: "[Registrar] May Zombie Auction"

* Is Aris's definition of "to refer a proposal to a chamber" now
  understood in a generic Agoran context? Aris calls CFJ 3834 in thread
  "[Promotor] Ministerial Referrals", but R. Lee judges it on a
  technicality.

* When does specifying invalid parameters cause proposal submission to
  fail? Jason drafts a judgement for CFJ 3833.

* Can R. Lee get a paradox victory out of eir coin CFJ? E tries, calling
  CFJ 3835 in the thread "more paradox CFJs". The Arbitor judges it
  IRRELEVANT, citing the responsibility of eir office to administer
  justice in a fair manner.

* Does a pledge to perform an action cease to exist before its maker can
  become guilty of not honouring it? R. Lee asks in the thread "Pledge
  Bug". It also comes up in the thread "[proposal] Prior violations".


# Miscellaneous

* The May zombie auction ends. Jason gets eir last bid in just under the
  wire. Threads: "[Registrar] May zombie auction status", "[Registrar]
  End of May zombie auction"

* Trigon appreciates Aris's draft Promotor reports. Thread: "[Promotor]
  Draft".

* Cuddle Beam claims Agora is ossified, but nch points out an error in
  eir reasoning. Thread: "Agora is currently ossified (but it's OK
  (kinda))"

* Aris starts a discussion on what happened to the MUD, and there's some
  talk of organizing a time to meet there. Thread: "MUD Post Mortem".

* Three players join the Dragon Corporation. Aris proposes amendments to
  make the office of President elected and to make the voting periods
  shorter. Falsifian becomes president after buying the most shares.
  Threads have "Dragon" in the subject line.

* R. Lee announces intent to enter CFJ 3831 into moot. CFJ 3831 is about
  whether Murphy's Notice of Honour with "-1 kudo" and "+1 kudo" worked.
  There is discussion of the moot process and talk of bringing back an
  appeals process. "Moot Attempt"
