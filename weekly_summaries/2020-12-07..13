# Summary

WIP

What does Murphy want with the Protection Stone that's worth 135 Coins
to em?


# Fungibility

These actions followed some discussion in the IRC/Discord discussion
forum.

* Jason proposes to define a "currency" to be anything that's fungible,
  instead of saying everything declared to be a currency is fungible.
  G. asks some questions and Jason retracts the proposal. Thread:
  "[proposal] Reversing the Arrow"

* ATMunn tries to transfer "the coin that has been in [eir] possession
  the longest". E calls CFJ 3891 to see what happened, leading to some
  discussion including a tangent about cryptocurrencies. Threads:
  "[CFJ, @Treasuror] why not", "[Arbitor] CFJ 3891 Assigned to G."


# Miscellaneous

* Why does R2478 make it so hard to Point a Finger? P.S.S. publishes a
  proto (and other(s) comment on it) that would the requirements a bit,
  after explaining the current phrasing is due to someone making "very
  vague accusations". Thread: "[ADoP] Metareport" / "Proto: Specified
  Crime not Rule".

* lucidiot agrees to replace ATMunn as Orchardoror, and the contract
  amendment process begins in the thread "[Attn. all Orchardors] Re:
  BUS: [Orchardoror] Intent to Resign"

* G. gives up on the Barrels game, resigning the office and submitting
  a proposal to repeal its rules. Thread: "[proposal][@ADoP] no
  bargaining"

* The second Stone auction is resolved. The Protection, Sabatoge and
  Wealth stones were up for auction. Thread: "[Stonemason] December
  Stone Auction Resolution"

* The Agoran Press runs out of money again. Murphy tries to sell eir
  credit via a promise instead of cashing it via the usual method.
  Thread: "[Agoran Press] Payroll (attn Treasuror)"

  * There has been earlier discussion about changing the mechanism for
    funding charities so that they can better keep up with inflation.
