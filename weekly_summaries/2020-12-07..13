# Summary

A quiet week. The second Stone auction is resolved, and Murphy now owns
three of Agora's six Stones. G. proposes to retire eir "Bargains on the
Barrel" game, which unfortunately never received much attention.
lucidiot agrees to take over as Orchardoror, and there's some
discussion of finger-pointing precision.

This week's tricky questions are about fungibility. ATMunn tries to
transfer eir oldest coin, and Jason proposes to define currencies an
fungible things instead of saying currencies are fungible.


# Fungibility

These actions followed some discussion in the IRC/Discord discussion
forum.

* Jason proposes to define a "currency" to be anything that's fungible,
  instead of saying everything declared to be a currency is fungible.
  G. asks some questions and Jason retracts the proposal. Thread:
  "[proposal] Reversing the Arrow"

* ATMunn tries to transfer "the coin that has been in [eir] possession
  the longest". E calls CFJ 3891 to see what happened, leading to some
  discussion including a tangent about cryptocurrencies. Threads:
  "[CFJ, @Treasuror] why not", "[Arbitor] CFJ 3891 Assigned to G."


# Miscellaneous

* Why does R2478 make it so hard to Point a Finger? P.S.S. publishes a
  proto (and other(s) comment on it) that would the requirements a bit,
  after explaining the current phrasing is due to someone making "very
  vague accusations". Thread: "[ADoP] Metareport" / "Proto: Specified
  Crime not Rule".

* lucidiot agrees to replace ATMunn as Orchardoror, and the contract
  amendment process begins in the thread "[Attn. all Orchardors] Re:
  BUS: [Orchardoror] Intent to Resign"

* G. gives up on the Barrels game, resigning the office and submitting
  a proposal to repeal its rules. Thread: "[proposal][@ADoP] no
  bargaining"

* The second Stone auction is resolved. The Protection, Sabatoge and
  Wealth stones were up for auction. Thread: "[Stonemason] December
  Stone Auction Resolution"

* The Agoran Press runs out of money again. Murphy tries to sell eir
  credit via a promise instead of cashing it via the usual method.
  Thread: "[Agoran Press] Payroll (attn Treasuror)"

  * There has been earlier discussion about changing the mechanism for
    funding charities so that they can better keep up with inflation.
