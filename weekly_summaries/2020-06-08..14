# Justice reforms

* Discussion continues about having multiple types of judicial cases,
  and in what order and how quickly to do things, in the threads
  "Judicial Diversification" and "court restructuring - in phases".

* Aris circulates a draft proposal for equity cases, leading to
  discussion including at least one other overall approach. Thread:
  "Equation (equity cases)"

* Aris asks for opinions onwhether we'd like to see criminal cases
  decided by judges again, in the thread "Criminal Cases".


# Miscellaneous

* There's discussion about threading being messed up for some messages,
  possibly due to KMail's behaviour when changing a To: address. Thread:
  "[NAX] Improved Amendment Procedures"

* Cuddle Beam opens an "occult shop" selling "Mystical Items and
  Spells". E attracks some customers, and an attempted win by paradox
  involving a purported Scam Banishment Ritual. Thread: "humble agoran
  farmer opens a humble agoran occult shop"

  * Cuddle Beam also visits other threads to sell eir wares. ("Judicial
    Diversification", "State of the Dragon")


# Other Proposals

* Aris revives an old idea from November, "Interested Proposals", in
  which someone can create a "disinterested" proposal which will not
  earn em a reward. Unlike the first version, there's no cost difference
  between submitting interested and disinterested proposals, except that
  certified patches (if that change is adopted) would be both free and
  disinterested.

* There's debate over Aris's proposed replacement of "in an officially
  timely fashion" with "in a stately fashion" in the thread "Stately
  Officiation".
