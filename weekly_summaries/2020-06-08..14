    some comments on what exactly Cuddle Beam is selling. Thread: "Finger
    Pointing at Cuddlebeam"

    * The Referee finds the finger-pointing to be shenanegans because it
      was too obvious to be misleading, and ais523 says this makes em

      arguments happened during a period in the past.

  Service"

  efficiency, arguing participation makes more sense. Thread: "Interest
  intent"


# Other Proposals

* Aris revives an old idea from November, "Interested Proposals", in
  which someone can create a "disinterested" proposal which will not
  earn em a reward. Unlike the first version, there's no cost difference
  between submitting interested and disinterested proposals, except that
  certified patches (if that change is adopted) would be both free and
  disinterested.

  timely fashion" with "in a stately fashion" in the thread "Stately
  Officiation".

  pointing every week, but punish people for repeated shenanegans.

  "Administrative State" proposal which gives power to the players
  rather than defining "official consent" for decisions up to just
  officers. Thread: "Populist Administration"

* G. proposes to let judges extend their deadlines by one week by
  announcement, since self-filed motions to reconsider can already be
  used to do that. Thread: "motion for extension"


# Contracts

* Cuddle Beam amends eir occult shop contract to include tarot cards
  with hashed fortunes. Thread: "humble agoran occultist now also does
  fortune telling (pick a card!)"

* Work continues on the LoAFER contract (League of Agorans Facilitating
  Accurate Recordkeeping). Threads have "LoAFER" in the subject line.

* Jason drafts a contract for handling arbitration related to other
  contracts. Thread: "Arbitration"

  * Discussion turns to having game mechanics be put in contracts
    instead of in the rules, starting with ais523 saying a contract
    would be a great way to do equity without needing to change the
    rules.

  * There's also a tangent about modifying the CFJ system to handle
    contract arbitration.


# Rules questions
