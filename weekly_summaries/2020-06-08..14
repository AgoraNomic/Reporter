    proclamations.

* G. proposes a game built on the new Sets economy. Thread: "Barrel
  rolling"

  * There's some debate about phrasing triggering R2579 to make winning
    require payment of 100 barrels, and whether winning the game is an
    action.

    * G. proposes to rephrase winning by paradox to be a new action
      (Transcending Logic) which causes winning, to address potential
      bugs related to fee-based actions and whether winning the game is
      an action. Thread: "indirect wins"

  * There's discussion of ways players could collude to win.

* G. proposes regular auctions of Victory Cards together with assets
  owned by the Lost and Found Department. Thread: "Victory auctions"

# Miscellaneous

* There's discussion about threading being messed up for some messages,

* Aris and ATMunn indicate interest in judging cases. Thread: "Judicial
  Service"

* The Reportor gets lovely compliments.

  intent to flip it to participation. Thread: "Interest intent"

* The June zombie auction ends. Lets hope it worked this time!

  * There's discussion about how the auction rules should work next
    time, since it's expected the auction rules will be changed by then
    to give a lot of leeway in how they're run.

* Fun with nicknames:

  * After Jason calls a CFJ that CFJ 3835 is G., G. changes eir nickname
    to CFJ 3835. Thread: "[CFJs] on weird switch phrasing"

  * G. submits a proposal that a player's legal nickname is the CFJ they

  the coins without objection. Some people join. Thread: "humble agoran
  farmer now has a pegleg and an eyepatch"


# Other Proposals

* Aris revives an old idea from November, "Interested Proposals", in
  which someone can create a "disinterested" proposal which will not
  earn em a reward. Unlike the first version, there's no cost difference
  between submitting interested and disinterested proposals, except that
  certified patches (if that change is adopted) would be both free and
  disinterested.

* There's debate over Aris's proposed replacement of "in an officially
  timely fashion" with "in a stately fashion" in the thread "Stately
  Officiation".

  * Aris proposes "in a sedate fashion" instead. Thread: "Sedate
    Officiation"

* G. proposes to codify in law the tradition of Prime Ministers not
  running for a second term. Trigon objects to codifying tratitions as
  law. Thread: "A term limit"

* Aris proposes a simple method for changing rule titles. Thread:
  "Easier Retitling"

* nch proposes to reward the player who did the most successful finger
  pointing every week, but punish people for repeated shenanegans.
  Thread: "Competitive Finger Pointing"

* Aris proposes an alternative of eir currently-up-for-voting
  "Administrative State" proposal which gives power to the players
  rather than defining "official consent" for decisions up to just
  officers. Thread: "Populist Administration"

* G. proposes to let judges extend their deadlines by one week by
  announcement, since self-filed motions to reconsider can already be
  used to do that. Thread: "motion for extension"

* R. Lee proposes to allow the Promotor to ignore "excess proposals",
  meaning more than 6 from the same person in a week. Thread: "Excess
  Proposals"


# Contracts

* Cuddlebeam opens an "occult shop" selling "Mystical Items and
  Spells". E attracks some customers. Thread: "humble agoran farmer
  opens a humble agoran occult shop"

  * Cuddlebeam also visits other threads to sell eir wares. ("Judicial
    Diversification", "State of the Dragon")

  * R. Lee Points er Finger at Cuddlebeam for Faking. This leads to
    some comments on what exactly Cuddlebeam is selling. Thread: "Finger
    Pointing at Cuddlebeam"

    * The Referee finds the finger-pointing to be shenanegans because it
      was too obvious to be misleading, and ais523 says this makes em
      nostalgic because similar "too obviously false to be misleading"
      arguments happened during a period in the past.

  * E later amends the contract to include tarot cards with hashed
    fortunes. Thread: "humble agoran occultist now also does fortune
    telling (pick a card!)"

* Work continues on the LoAFER contract (League of Agorans Facilitating
  Accurate Recordkeeping). Threads have "LoAFER" in the subject line.

* Jason drafts a contract for handling arbitration related to other
  contracts. Thread: "Arbitration"

  * Discussion turns to having game mechanics be put in contracts
    instead of in the rules, starting with ais523 saying a contract
    would be a great way to do equity without needing to change the
    rules.

  * There are tangents about modifying the CFJ system to handle contract
    arbitration, or having an officer handle it, and about limiting
    finger-pointings.


# Rules questions and testing the rules

* Falsifian attempts to get a CFJ judged PARADOXICAL, based on the
  question of whether a purported anti-scam spell sold by Cuddlebeam's
  occult shop destroys its own text.

* Do actions and CFJs in Spanish work? Jason judges CFJ 3841 after
  circulating a draft receiving comments.

* G. purports to ossify Agora, leading to: finger-pointing; the
  initation of the indictment process for the High Crime of Engaging in
  Forbidden Arts; bugs being found in that process; a proposal by P.S.S.
  to fix the bugs; and a possible levying of a lesser fine for the same
  conduct that might block the indictment from finally resulting in its
  own fine. Threads: "criminal behavior", "Indictment Fixes"

  * G. announces intent to deputise for Prime Minister to appoint emself
    Speaker, which would have em hold all three offices in the priority
    list for the Judge of the Indictment against em in R2619. Thread:
    "criminal leadership"

* Cuddlebeam attempts to hold Agora hostage with a contract that might
  Agora's ruleset if anyone votes against a proposal that e wins (or
  does something in a list of other conditions). Thread: "humble agoran
  farmer sets up tripwire"

* Jason Points eir Finger at the Arbitor, G., for not assigning a judge
  to and old CFJ because its judge (the Pineapple Partnership) ceased to
  be a person long ago. G. does a bit of research on the history of the
  Pineapple Partnership and CFJ rules at the time. Thread: "Pineapples
  aren't people"

  * G. proposes fixes. Threads: "v. quick judicial fix", "The
    other fix"

  * G. proposes a fix to a different possible problem. Thread: "help
    help i'm prisoner in a proposal-writing factory"

* Jason calls CFJs and argues that CFJ 3835 is G.. Thread: "[CFJs] on
  weird switch phrasing"
