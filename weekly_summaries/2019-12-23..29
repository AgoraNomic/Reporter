# Mailing list trouble

* omd diagnoses the recent trouble with the mailing list, and fixes it
  by "relaying mail through a different server". Thread: "[Distributor]
  list status". (Also previous threads: "test", "test should fail".)

  * Ã˜rjan says e found earlier this year that the list IP was on a
    global spam blacklist, and wonders whether the IP is actually being
    used for spam. Thread: "DIS: test".

  * See also message "DIS: Pinpointing end of list outage (was BUS:
    Might as well try)".

* Aris points out that messages sent during the outage may not have
  been validly sent via public fora, and calls a CFJ asking whether
  Proposal 8277 was distributed. Thread: "[Distributor] list status".

* After omd fixes the mailing list, Falsifian repeats some actions e
  attempted during the trouble (becoming a candidate for PM, earning
  Coins, flipping master switches to Agora).


# Miscellaneous

* Aris announces a new Agoran MUD in collaboration with Jason Cobb and
  solicits help building it. Thread: "[MUD] New Agoran MUD". For some
  context, see also the November thread "Agoran MOO?".

* omd publishes some thoughts on CFJ 3783, which e is assigned to
  judge.


# Events that may not have happened due to mailing list trouble

Because a substantial number of players may not have received the
messages involved, the following events might not have happened.

* Voting continues on Proposal 8277. (The proposal may not have been
  distributed.)

* Falsifian nominates emself as a candidate for Prime Minister.
  (Listing under "may not have happened" because The Prime Minister
  election may not have been initiated.)

* Falsifian announces intent to Declare Apathy (hoping it will be
  overlooked due to the mailing list trouble) and receives objections.
