# Mailing list trouble

* omd diagnoses the recent trouble with the mailing list, and tries a
  couple of ways to fix it. From-address rewriting for all messages has
  been temporarily enabled. Thread: "[Distributor] list status". (Also
  previous threads: "test", "test should fail".)

  * Ørjan says e found earlier this year that the list IP was on a
    global spam blacklist, and wonders whether the IP is actually being
    used for spam. Thread: "DIS: test".

  * Ørjan points out there's no reverse DNS for the mail server, which
    omd fixes.

  * Falsifian attempts to a few actions again in case they weren't sent
    in public messages (becoming a candidate for PM, earning Coins,
    flipping master switches to Agora).

  * See also message "DIS: Pinpointing end of list outage (was BUS:
    Might as well try)".

* Aris points out that messages sent during the outage may not have
  been validly sent via public fora, and calls a CFJ asking whether
  Proposal 8277 was distributed. Thread: "[Distributor] list status".

* Propsals and debate follow from Aris's observation.

  * Murphy proposes to ratify a document stating that the messages were
    sent to the Public Forum. This is Propsoal 8278. Thread: "Proposal:
    Resolve the troubles".

    * Jason Cobb points out this proposal may not work due to the
      difference between sending "to" and "via" a public forum. Murphy
      submits an updated proposal, "Resolve the troubles v1.1".

  * Aris argues for doing the opposite, and submits a proposal intended
    to make it so none of the messages count. This is Propsoal 8279.
    Thread: "Equitable Detroubling".

  * Ørjan claims both proposals are at risk of doing something
    different from what we expect, due to the large time difference
    between the date of ratification and the dates of the events being
    ratified. Thread: "[Promotor] Distribution of Proposals 8277-8279".

    * Ørjan suggests creating a separate ratifying document for each
      email message. ais523 suggests instead sending a message to the
      backup list ratifying that agora-business and agora-official were
      not public fora. Aris suggests also ratifying that they started
      being public fora again later. Falsifian suggests sidestepping
      the issue by directly describing the gamestate modification in
      the proposal.

  * Aris announces intent to ratify without objection two documents.
    The first makes agora-business and agora-official into discussion
    fora on Dec 14, and the second makes them into public fora on Dec
    28.

    * Alexis argues that this is the wrong approach, since e believes
      ratification would not change history. Aris responds by citing a
      thesis by Falsifian which concludes that ratification does change
      history, as seen by the rules. Thread: "[RWO] List Patch".


# Voting

* Voting begins on Proposals 8277-8279, except that voting might have
  already begun on Proposal 8277 when H. Promotor Aris distributed it
  during the mailing list trouble.

  * G. attempts to create a paradox using the vote of a zombie (Rance)
    e might only control if Propsoal 8278 is adopted. ais523 doesn't
    think it would work; see also Jason Cobb's observation of a wording
    error in the proposal, and Ørjan's later objection to both
    Proposals 8277 and 8279.

* Murphy attempts to resolve a PM election as uncontested, with
  Falsifian as the only candidate, leading to some discussion. (The
  message purporting to initiate the election was sent during the
  mailing list trouble.) Thread: "BUS: PM Candidacy".


# Scams

* Gaelan proposes a scam to get around Rule 1030's prohibition on
  enacting new rules that override it as a means of determining
  precedence. G. points out a potential problem and Jason Cobb suggests
  a way to get around it. Thread: "Proposal: precedence scam?".


# Miscellaneous

* Aris announces a new Agoran MUD in collaboration with Jason Cobb and
  solicits help building it, and describes how e thinks it might be
  used. Thread: "[MUD] New Agoran MUD". For some context, see also the
  November thread "Agoran MOO?".

* omd publishes some thoughts on CFJ 3783, which e is assigned to
  judge.

* Aris stands for PM, in case e hasn't already. Thread: "[MUD] New
  Agoran MUD".

* Aris asks for details on an incident e heard of where a person
  attempted to register twice at the same time under different names. E
  gets some responses, including a description of the "Annabel crisis".
  Thread: "Research Question".

* H. Arbitor G. calls for more judges. Thread: "[Arbitor] Judge Check".

  * In response, former player R. Lee re-registers and offers to judge
    cases, but says e will not otherwise play the game actively.


# Events that may not have happened due to mailing list trouble

Because a substantial number of players may not have received the
messages involved, the following events might not have happened.

* Voting continues on Proposal 8277. (The proposal may not have been
  distributed.)

* Falsifian nominates emself as a candidate for Prime Minister.
  (Listing under "may not have happened" because The Prime Minister
  election may not have been initiated.)

* Falsifian announces intent to Declare Apathy (hoping it will be
  overlooked due to the mailing list trouble) and receives objections.
