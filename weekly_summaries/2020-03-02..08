This report is incomplete. It does not account for emails to the Agora
lists from 2020-03-07 19:19 UTC onward (first missing email is G.'s

# Rules questions

* Discussion continues on twg's and Cuddle Beam's obligations under
  their "Chattlebeam" contract. Thread: "humble agoran farmer becomes
  chattel"

* People discuss Warrigal's proposal to enact a rule awarding a coin to
  an unspecified player. Thread: "Let's toss us a coin, shall we?"

  * This leads to a discussion on why we never judge CFJs DISMISS due
    to ambiguity in the rules.

  * There is discussion in the thread about what it means for things to
    be indeterminate or ambiguous.

  * twg suggests making ownership an asset switch, since Rule 2162
    (Switches) already has a provision about indeterminate values.

* R. Lee judges CFJ 3819, on whether Gaelan's bid of "I bid n coins in
  this auction, where n is 1 higher than the current highest bid."
  worked. E judges it IRRELEVANT, but also notes in eir judgement that
  the bid would not have work because it would require effort for
  Agorans to figure out how much e bid, meaning the amount wasn't
  "specified".

* After some discussion, Jason CFJ 3818 FALSE. In particular, e finds
  that e was able to make conditional action based on whether a zombie
  auction existed, even though it wasn't obvious to the players at the
  time whether the condition was true or false.

* Gaelan judges CFJ 3813 FALSE. Agora is not a contract. There was much
  discussion the week before last on the topic, in the thread "CFJ 3813
  proto-judged FALSE". Cuddle Beam raises a related question, about a
  hypothetical ship-of-Theseus situation. Thread: "CFJ 3813 judged
  FALSE"


# The Dragon Corporation

Thread: "The Dragon Corporation"

* Jason identifies a possible bug, and Warrigal, as sole party to the
  contract, amends it in response.

* Gaelan tries to buy shares to execute a "hostile takeover", hinting e
  may have done it to make eir job as Notary easier.

  * E accidentally sends the message to the discussion forum. Warrigal
    tries to correct for that using the "Gaelan's Really Bad At Sending
    Things To The Public Forum" contract, but G. points out it likely
    didn't work since Gaelan's message involved consenting to a
    contract.


# Miscellaneous

* There is discussion about top-posting on the thread "Clean r2493
  (Regulations)". R. Lee pledges with a time period of 1 million years
  to not top-post more than 5 times.

* Cuddle Beam and twg make promises to each other related to their
  Chattlebeam contract. Thread: "humble agoran farmer pledges loyalty
  to the deal"

* Jason proposes adding a provision to the rules to prevent proposals
  from accidentally taking effect twice. Thread: "[Proposal] solving
  double proposal effects"

  * The purpose is to prevent situations like one we had last month,
    where we proposals might have been adopted twice due to a first
    message from the Assessor that may or may not have worked, and
    self-ratifying second message from the Assessor.

* The registrar announces the postponment of the March zombie auction.
