# Birthday Tournament: Diplonomic

Threads have "[Diplonomic 2020]" in the subject line.

* Play continues. Results of turns have subjects like "Resolution of
  Fall 1901". omd publishes maps to
  https://agoranomic.org/omd-diplonomic-2020-maps/ (and the Gamemaster
  also attaches maps to emails).

* The gamemmaster gives a reminder and advice about conditional orders
  for retreats and builds. Thread: "Advice and Information about
  Conditionals and Missing Information"

* An anonymous player writes some news headlines about the game. Thread:
  "Chicago International Tribune"


# Contracts

* A rival to the Plundership appears. Thread: "Contract: A Rival Ship
  Appears"

* ATMunn creates a contract for governing Contract Awards, and publishes
  the first week of awards. Threads: "Contract Awards", "Contract
  Awards: Week 1"


# History

* There's discussion of how Black Ribbons have been earned in the past,
  since it looks like Proposal 8473 is going to grant them to many
  players this week. Details of one scam are discussed. Thread:
  "Distribution of Proposals 8473-8476"
