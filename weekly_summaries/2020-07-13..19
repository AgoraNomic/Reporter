Note: I'm trying to reduce the amount of material a bit. For example,
I'm generally not covering threads that simply introduce draft
proposals; if they're significant, they should show up later in a
distribution.


# Summary

We have a new win by Raising a Banner! This time it's by Jason, barely a
year after first registering. Jason's win comes after a proposal is
adopted granting Black Ribbons; there's some discussion in the voting
thread of the history of Black Ribbons.

The Birthday Tournament continues, now with anonymous proposals for added
mystery.

We also have a new game gathering steam: R. Lee is elected to Cooper.

We continue to play with contracts. The Notary's Contract Awards are now
govered by, of course, a contract. The Plundership has a new rival, and
a Ponzi scheme starts. Cuddlebeam tries to make an infinite-victory
engine but people don't seem keen to collaborate. A new rule allowing
contracts to be funded (with 3 Agoran consent) is adopted.

A significant change to our karma system: you can now grant karma
to a player without taking it from another player. (The reverse is also
possible.)

ATMunn pledges not to say "tacos" and then says it. There are deep
questions here. Later, Jason asks whether we CAN send public messages.


# Victory

* Jason Raises a Banner. (G. points out that at just over a year since
  registration, this is a very fast Renaissance victory.) Thread: "[DoV]
  With apologies to G."


# Birthday Tournament: Diplonomic

Threads have "[Diplonomic 2020]" in the subject line.

* Play continues. Results of turns have subjects like "Resolution of
  Fall 1901". omd publishes maps to
  https://agoranomic.org/omd-diplonomic-2020-maps/ (and the Gamemaster
  also attaches maps to emails).

* The gamemmaster gives a reminder and advice about conditional orders
  for retreats and builds. Thread: "Advice and Information about
  Conditionals and Missing Information"

* An anonymous player writes some news headlines about the game. Thread:
  "Chicago International Tribune"

* Some proposals are enacted, including changing proposal submission to
  be anonymous.


# Proposals and Voting

* R. Lee is elected to the new office of Cooper.

* Proposals 8473-8476 are resolved. All four are adopted:

  * Everyone who votes FOR gets a Black Ribbon. (8473)

  * Allow karma to be given to (or taken from) a player without
    balancing with another player. (8474)

  * Make the authors of the previous two proposals eligible for rewards,
    patching over a hiccup caused by a rule change. (8476)

  * Allow "charity" contracts to be publicly funded. (8476)

    * This idea has been tossed around for a while. It comes out of a
      conversation about having things like offices, but without permanent
      assignments. G. drafted the original version of the proposal.

* Voting begins on Proposal 8477, which would allow players holding more
  than one office to grant Cards for each office separately (rather than
  a maximum of once per month).


# Contracts

* A rival to the Plundership appears. Threads: "Contract: A Rival Ship
  Appears", "Platonic Parrot Amendment"

* ATMunn creates a contract for governing Contract Awards, and publishes
  the first week of awards. Threads: "Contract Awards", "Contract
  Awards: Week 1"

* Jason creates a "Ponzi scheme". Thread: "A wild Ponzi scheme appears
  [attn. Notary]"


# Scams

* Cuddlebeam creates a contract designed to hold 8 people who will
  continually win by pooling the Victory Cards they get after each
  reset. The idea is not received well and e distroys the contract.
  There's some discussion about what kind of reset should happen when
  someone wins with Victory Points. Thread: "humble agoran farmer
  something something INFINITY ENGINE"


# Rule questions

* If one pledges not to say "tacos" and then says it in a discussion
  forum, did one break the rules? (Is saying "tacos" a regulated
  action?) Thread: "Pledge Shenanigans"

* Is 2+2=5 if enough of us believe it? CFJ 3862 judged IRRELEVANT,
  leading to some discussion in the thread "CFJ 3862 Assigned to R. Lee"

* Did Falsifian accidentally create an Agoran proposal too when e
  created a Diplonomic proposal? CFJ 3836 judged FALSE.

* CAN we send public messages? Thread: "Participating in the Fora"


# History

* There's discussion of how Black Ribbons have been earned in the past,
  since it looks like Proposal 8473 is going to grant them to many
  players this week. Details of one scam are discussed. Thread:
  "Distribution of Proposals 8473-8476"


# Miscellaneous

* The player formerly known as nch will now be known as nix. Thread:
  "Name and Address Change"

* The Notary petitions to have Participation added to eir interest, and
  the ADoP announces intent to do so.  Thread: "Friendly Neighborhood
  Notary Petitions the Honorable Associate Director of Personnel for a
  Change of Interest"

* The first Victory Auction ends; ATMunn wins the new Victory Card.

* The Treasuror publishes new draft auction regulations. Thread:
  "Auction regulations again"

* The Webmastor announces a refactoring of the homepage (no visible
  change). Thread: "Homepage Update Shoutout"

* The ADoP loses eir database, but is saved by a backup Jason posted to
  the list earlier. Thread: "Self-abasement"
