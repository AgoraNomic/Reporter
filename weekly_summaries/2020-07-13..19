# Birthday Tournament: Diplonomic

Threads have "[Diplonomic 2020]" in the subject line.

* Play continues. Results of turns have subjects like "Resolution of
  Fall 1901". omd publishes maps to
  https://agoranomic.org/omd-diplonomic-2020-maps/ (and the Gamemaster
  also attaches maps to emails).

* The gamemmaster gives a reminder and advice about conditional orders
  for retreats and builds. Thread: "Advice and Information about
  Conditionals and Missing Information"

# Scams

* Cuddlebeam creates a contract designed to hold 8 people who will
  continually win by pooling the Victory Cards they get after each
  reset. The idea is not received well and e distroys the contract.
  There's some discussion about what kind of reset should happen when
  someone wins with Victory Points. Thread: "humble agoran farmer
  something something INFINITY ENGINE"


# History
