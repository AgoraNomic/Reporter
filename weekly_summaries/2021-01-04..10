# Mayhem

* Cuddlebeam disables G.'s CFJ archive website, and claims victory over
  "the insidious and tyrannical cfj archives". E goes own to
  purportedly Deploy an Army, and makes other grand and imaginative
  claims. Thread: "Attack on the CFJ-A"

    illustration of Cuddlebeam's army, is immortalized at

  * There's some discussion of whether Cuddlebeam's message violated
    the No Faking rule, and whether e took any effective action in eir
    message.

  * Gaelan points eir finger at Cuddlebeam for violating No Faking. Our
    interim referee and new player, JTAC, publishes a detailed analysis
    of the situation, ultimately declaring the finger-pointing to be
    Shenanigans. There is some follow-up discussion.
