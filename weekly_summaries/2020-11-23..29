# Summary

Out with the old, in with the new. The phase-out of the old zombie
rules is almost done, with four zombies deregistered this week and only
one left (twg). Meanwhile, our first auction under the new Stone rules
ends.

Aris publishes a draft of a judgement about the "four factors" which
every judge seems to have printed on eir judgement stationery.

No, Jason did not make a pledge just by publishing auction regulations
with a SHALL when e started an auction.

Agoran Press budget confusion persists, but your brave Reportors carry
on.

# Rule questions

* Are the four factors a strict checklist? Aris publishes a draft
  judgement of CFJ 3890 finding that it is not. Thread: "CFJ 3890
  Assigned to Aris (the ANCS approach)"; for some context, see last
  week's thread "On Rule 217 and the Four Factors: Another Proposal
  Prospectus".

  * There's discussion on whether the common use of "the four factors"
    to refer to the factors listed in the second sentence of Rule 217
    is misleading, since the text should also be considered.

* Did Jason make a pledge by publishing auction regulations when e
  initiated an auction? No: nix judges CFJ 3888 FALSE (subject: "CFJ
  3888 JUDGED FALSE") after gathering evidence in the thread "[CFJ] Re:
  OFF: [Stonemason] Throwing Stones".


# Miscellaneous

* Our first Stone auction ends. Thread: "[Stonemason] November Stone
  Auction Resolution"

* With the December 1 deadline approaching, players adjust their
  focusses in the thread "[Ministor] Focus Warning".

* There's some confusion about the coin balance of the Agoran Press.
  Thread: "Agoran Press credit (attn Falsifian, Treasuror)"

* Falsifian deregisters four players, leaving only one remaining
  zombie. Since zombies are being phased out (Rule 2639), it's likely
  no more zombies will be created for now, except as a temporary step
  toward being deregistered. Thread: "[Registrar] Second-last rites"
