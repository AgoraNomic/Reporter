# Voting

* Voting continues on Proposals 8524-8525.


# Rule questions

* Are the four factors a strict checklist? Aris publishes a draft
  judgement of CFJ 3890 finding that it is not. Thread: "CFJ 3890
  Assigned to Aris (the ANCS approach)"; for some context, see last
  week's thread "On Rule 217 and the Four Factors: Another Proposal
  Prospectus".

  * There's discussion on whether the common use of "the four factors"
    to refer to the factors listed in the second sentence of Rule 217
    is misleading, since the text should also be considered.

* Did Jason make a pledge by publishing auction regulations when e
  initiated an auction? Judge nix gathers evidence in the thread "[CFJ]
  Re: OFF: [Stonemason] Throwing Stones".


# Miscellaneous

* Our first Stone auction ends. Thread: "[Stonemason] November Stone
  Auction Resolution"
