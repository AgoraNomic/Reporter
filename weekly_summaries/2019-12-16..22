  messages. Our H. Distributor, omd, is alerted at the very end of the
  week and begins to work on the problem. (Thread: "test".)


# Voting

* Voting begins on Proposal 8277, which begins "I transfer 5 coins to
  each player...".

    adopted. There was some discussion last week on it last week.

* H. ADoP Murphy resolves the Prime Minister election as FAILED QUORUM
  and initiates a new one.
