# Mailing list trouble

* Certain list subscribers continue to be unable to receive list
  messages. Our H. Distributor, omd, is alerted at the very end of the
  week and begins to work on the problem. (Thread: "test".)


# Miscellaneous

* Falsifian points out some errors in the last Full Logical Ruleset,
  which was published in October; some also apply to the Short Logical
  Rulesets that Jason Cobb recently published.


# Events that may not have happened due to mailing list trouble

Because a substantial number of players may not have received the
messages involved, the following events might not have happened.

* Voting begins on Proposal 8277, which begins "I transfer 5 coins to
  each player...".

  * Murphy calls CFJs on what the effect of the proposal would be if
    adopted. There was some discussion last week on it last week.

* H. ADoP Murphy resolves the Prime Minister election as FAILED QUORUM
  and initiates a new one.

* omd is randomly selected as our new Comptrollor.
