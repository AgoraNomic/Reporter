Status: WIP. Covers everything through 2020-07-11 at 02:02 UTC.


# Voting

* The decisions on whether to adopt Proposals 8459-8472 are resolved.
  Adopted:

  * Handle zombies with assets ("Talismans") instead of switches. (8459,
    8467)

  * Don't let players immediately reclaim an Ultraviolet Ribbon after
    Raising a Banner. (8460)

  * Re-try a proposal that was adopted but failed to apply. (8461)

    * The Rulekeepor identifies an error with the new proposal.

  * Fixes and future-proofing. (8462, 8463, 8468, 8472)

    * 8472 is a fix related to the exile scam.

  * Repeal certification, and put in a replacement. (8466, 8470)

    * 8470 distinguishes proposals that were paid for as "sponsored",
      and thus eligible for rewards, but this status doesn't apply to
      proposals submitted before 8470. The Promotor submits a proposal
      to fix that in thge thread "Saving Sponsorship".

  * Make it not a crime to attempt actions harmful to Agora on
    non-public fora. (8465)

  * Amend the new rule about officer regulations by letting an officer
    repeal the regulations after being elected. (The proposal would also
    create that new rule if Proposal 8448 failed.) (8469)


# Rules questions

* Discussion continues on what a "bug" is on the thread "[Arbitor] CFJ
  3864 Assigned to G."


# Birthday Tournament: Diplonomic

* Aris announces that e will be teaming up with non-contestant Trigon.
  Thread: "[Diplonomic] Regulation BT7 Declaration"

  * Other Contestants announce they'd be happy to have teammates.
    Thread: "Diplonomic Teammate Request"

* Gamemaster P.S.S. assigns Great Powers to players and the game begins.
  Thread: "OFF: [Diplonomic 2020] Promulgation of Rules, Assignment of
  Powers, and Start of Play"

* Some proposals pass. One ("Team Play" by Aris) allows non-contestent
  "teammates" to win along with the contestants they're working with. The rest
  are clarifications or fixes.


# Contracts

* Trigon, in the context of the LoAFER contract, asks officers to tell
  Agorans how they can make officers' lives easier. Thread: "[LoAFER]
  [Poll] Thread of Grievances @Officers"

* Cuddlebeam creates a contract that automatically sells off eir cards.
  Thread: "humble agoran farmer opens a card shop [Attn. Notary]"

* nch destroys the NAX contract, saying it needs to be reworked and e
  will submit a new version later. Thread: "[NAX] [@Treasuror] Shutting
  down for now"

* Trigon's secret contracts:

    * Jason tries out Trigon's secret contract number 4. Thread:
      "[Notary] The Notes (weekly report)"

      * E first stashes all eir assets except 20 Coins (joining the
        contract requries 10) into a temporary holding contract for
        safekeeping.  Thread: "Temporary Lockbox"

      * It turns out the contract allows Trigon to sell Jason one Voting
        Card for 10 Coins, which e does.

    * R. Lee becomes a party to each of them. Thread: "Secret
      Contracts".

      * ATMunn also joins numbers 5 and 2.

      * R. Lee tries to leave number 6. This leads to a debate about
        whether e can leave the contract, which says e cannot. (Trigon
        meanwhile proposes to amend the contract so e can.) (E also
        presents evidence in the thread "Evidence for my most recent
        CFJ".)

        * This is CFJ 3865. Jason judges it FALSE, meaning R. Lee was
          not able to leave.

* ATMunn proposes a generic locker contract, where players can stash
  their goods for safekeeping. Thread: "Public Lockers"

  * In the discussion that follows, omd points out that putting in
    "acting as emself" as an anti-contract-scam protection can be worked
    around using promises, since promises don't require consent to
    create.

* ATMunn objects to an attempt by the Plundership to take the "Treasure"
  promise from the Lost and Found Department in the thread "Shiny Loot",
  suggesting it would be difficult to divide.

  * R. Lee announces intent to transfer the "Treasure" promise to emself
    instead, and pledges (class 1 million crime) to distribute the
    treasure e gets from omd. omd objects.

  * ATMunn proposes a parley to ban anybody who has objected to any
    plundering, not just coins. E later says it's been pointed out eir
    own parley would kick em out of the contract.

* Cuddlebeam destroys eir Mystical Menagerie contract.  Thread: "humble
  agoran farmer does some contract cleanup"

* Cuddlebeam tries to create a contract that periodically reproduces.
  Thread: "humble agoran farmer creates life"

  * There's debate about whether the contract can reproduce itself
    automatically.

  * Cuddlebeam restarts the experiment with a typo fixed and a shorter
    time between reproducing, then stops the experiment after waiting a
    few minutes for reproduction to happen. Thread: "humble agoran
    farmer continues to play god [Attn. Notary]"


# Proposals

* ATMunn proposes to increase the number of Coins in a Welcome Package
  from 10 to 25, based on a Discord discussion. Thread: "Warmer Welcomes"

  * P.S.S. suggests allowing the Treasuror to control it, and ATMunn
    submits an updated proposal. Thread: "Regulated Welcomes"

* ATMunn circulates some new ideas related to an earlier proposal e had
  about having a Deck of cards. Thread: "Ideas for a Deck System"

* Jason suggests making card crants once per office per months rather
  than once per officer per month. Thread: "Definitely not a ploy to get
  more pendants"

* Trigon proposes to let unpended proposals disappear. Thread: "Some
  ideas I've been kicking around"

* Trigon proposes to give more difficult offices higher rewards. ATMunn
  suggests some assignments of difficulty, which are discussed. Thread:
  "Some ideas I've been kicking around"

* ATMunn re-submits a "Contract Charities" proposal originally by G.
  (and submitted but not pended by Falsifian). Threads: "Removals",
  "Contract Charities version 3 or something"


# Auctions

* Discussion of the Treasuror's draft auction regulations continues in
  the thread "[Treasuror] Second draft of auction regulations"

* The Treasuror initiates the first Victory Card auction. Thread:
  "[Treasuror] Victory Auction: July 2020"

  * Players try to bid fractional numbers of coins. The Treasuror says e
    plans to null any bids that exploit loopholes or are "generally
    unfair play". Later in the thread it's decided bids have to be
    integers because R2509 says a "number of (items)" is an integer by
    default.


# Miscellaneous

* ATMunn tries to take a "Treasure" promise that omd created on June 22
  from the Lost and Found Department by mixing the intent in with other
  business, but is discovered. Thread: "More Pledge Destruction"

* ATMunn declares that e ceases to exist, but is foiled by the fact that
  that is probably a regulated action. We learn what ATEOISIDTIDWHPAFALT
  stands for. Thread: "just a normal action"
