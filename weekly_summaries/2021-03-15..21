# Summary

An exciting week.

First of all, three new players joined us. We don't normally get so
many at one time. cuddlybanana, Aenet and Jumble: welcome to Agora, and
have fun!

G.'s victory-by-paradox attempt involving an infinite loop of
promise-based actions, was judged successful. Adding a bit of mystery
to the situation, G. declares that e is concerned about the proposed
fix, but offers no further comment.

Jason has compiled the data from eir term as Assesor into a lovely
thesis filled with graphs, on the topic of influence.

Apathy was a theme this week: there were a few intents announced,
involving a bit of creativity; and a couple of proposals related to
Apathy are up for voting.

Also this week: G. creates a proposal game; voting begins on
Cuddlebeam's indictment; and a question about rule text ratification
and revision numbers.


# New players

* New players register: cuddlybanana, Aenet, Jumble


# Victory and culture

* Jason submits a thesis about voting, titled "The Most Influential
  Agoran". Thread: "Voting Thesis"

* The Herald announces intent to award new Long Service Awards, and to
  backfill some old ones.

* Gaelan judges CFJ 3901 PARADOXICAL. This was called by G. based on a
  scam involving a promise that causes the creation of another promise,
  ad infinitum. This mean G. will win, unless something unexpected
  happens.


# Voting

* Voting begins on Proposals 8549-8553.

  * The proposals:

    * Patch the promise loophole G. used to call a PARADOXICAL CFJ.
      (8549)

    * Let the creator of a promise revoke it from the Library. (8550)

    * Allow non-players to win by apathy. (8552)

    * Prevent repeated Apathy wins. (8553)

  * There's a minor hiccup in the distribution, which the Promotor
    fixes in a new voting thread.


# New proposals and regulation changes

* G. makes a mysterious comment on Aris's proposal to fix promise
  loops: e's concerned about it, but would like to wait for the CFJ to
  be resolved before discussing it further.

* The Treasuror announces intent to amend the auction regulations to
  remove the time limit for the auctioneer to send a termination
  message.

* G. creates a proposal game: whoever votes FOR eir proposal and has
  the highest unique voting strength, gets a Victory Card. Subject: "a
  little bored and want something to vote on"

* Jason submits Apathy-related proposals: to allow non-players to be
  included in a set of Apathy winners; and to prevent repeated Apathy
  wins from the same player. (The latter leads to a little bit of
  discussion on repeated wins in general; thread: "[proposal] We care
  after the first time".)


# Economics

* The March stone auction ends. Stones go to Gaelan, Jason and G..


# Rule questions

(See also: CFJ 3901 in Victory and culture, above.)

* If a rule with incorrect rule text is ratified, does its revision
  number change? G. identifies such a situation: Rule 2029 (Town
  Fountain) was accidentially modified to replace "Goethe" with "G."
  when G. changed eir name, and the change was ratified. Threads: "CoE
  on Ruleset (maybe)", "[cfj] on ruleset ratification"; G. calls CFJ
  2902.


# Miscellaneous

* G. initiates decisions for the indictment of Cuddlebeam, for eir
  copycat abuse of an Oathbreaking loophole last month.

* Various apathy intents are announced.

  * One has subject "lol".

  * One is sent from an anonymous player. Thread: "Test"

  * One specifies the set of players who object to the intent as
    winners. Thread: "Apathy for all"

  * One's from new player Jumble. (No subject line, agora-official
    list.)

* G. points out it's not necessary to guard fee-based actions on
  whether they succeed, since the fee-based action rules already say
  nothing happens if the action doesn't work. Thread: "Legislating
  [attn. Treasuror]"
