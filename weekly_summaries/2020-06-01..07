# Summary

Welcome, Tyler!

A very busy week. With nch's new "Sets" economy coming, there's a rush
to submit proposals while submitting them is still free, leading the
Promotor to perform an unusual second distribution within the week.
Plenty of interesting ones, summarized in the sections below.

nch creates the Needlessly Abstract Exchange in anticipation of the new
economy, and the Dragon Corporation president promises new plans to
come.

Many proposals were adopted this week, including the office of the
Webmastor (filled by nch), outlawing actions dangerous to Agora, and
another attempt to fix auctions (with a wild auction experiment coming
on its heels). Let's see if we finally get a working zombie auction.

R. Lee seized the office of ADoP by deputizing this week, and many
office elections are under way.

What does negative karma mean? Is issuing blots a rebuke? Discussion on
these and other topics, and on treating each other well, referenced in
the "Honour, minor crimes, being nice to each other, gaming" section
below.

The Flappy Bird tournament isn't happening, but Agora's Birthday
tournament is coming up, and it looks like it will be Diplonomic. On the
subject of birthdays, happy birthday to Jason!

Agora's scholarly traditions continue. G. transforms eir earlier
arguments about the status of the ancient CFJ 7 into a thesis, and many
rules questions are discussed in other threads, including one in
Spanish.

Some other topics this week: rules about player intent; choosing good
terminology; continued discussion whether players should follow the
rules (including bringing back a crime/infraction distinction).


# Registrations

# History and Academics

* R. Lee pledges a bounty for filling in all the gaps in the CFJ
  database in the years 2018 and 2019. Thread: "Pledge (attention COTC)"

* G. submits a thesis: "On the Continuity of the Agoran Judicial
  System". It is based on eir arguments as Arbitor in March 2020 that e
  could assign the ancient CFJ 7 to a new judge. It touches on how to
  handle uncertainty over what may have happened over 26 years of
  gameplay.


# Rules questions

* Should a CFJ entangling facts normally irrelevant to the game with
  facts relevant to the game be judged IRRELEVANT? grok indeed judges
  CFJ 3837 IRRELEVANT, after some continued discussion, including
  discussion of the intended vs. actual meaning of the CFJ statement.
  Threads: "CFJ 3837 Assigned to grok", "CFJ 3837"

* Can a player claim the same colour of glitter twice in a row for two
  separate instances of earning that colour of ribbon? The Herald opines
  yes. Thread: "Long Service Awards".

* Jason asks: Will the game of Agora ever end? Thread: "Is death
  inevitable?". This becomes CFJ 3839.

* Do actions and CFJs in Spanish work? ATMunn tries, and some past
  examples of use of languages other than English are discussed. Thread:
  "¿Puedo realizar acciónes en español?". CFJs 3840 and 3841.

* Can confusion about ID numbers invalidate a proposal distribution? The
  Promoter opines it can't, in thread "Distribution of Proposals
  8388-8404".


# Auctions and zombies

* The Registrar raises a concern about "no stinking auction definitions"
  being adopted in the middle of a zombie auction. The Assessor says e
  is okay with holding off resolution of the proposal until auction
  winners have had a chance to claim their winnings. Thread: "a
  regulatory experiment (auctions)"

* The June zombie auction begins.


# Contracts

* Trigon circulates more drafts of the LoAFER contract for players who
  want to help officers keep accurate records, and solicits preferences
  from officers about how they would prefer messages requiring their
  attention to be marked.

* nch creates the Needlesly Abstract Exchange, a contract for trading.
  Players join and amendments are applied. Threads: "The Needlessly
  Abstract Exchange" or others with "NAX" in the subject line.

* Dragon Corporation President Aris announces that some new plans are
  afoot related to Sets. Subject: "State of the Dragon"


# Honour, minor crimes, being nice to each other, gaming

* Some discussion of how seriously people take negative karma and
  punishment, and about treating each other well and how to handle
  sensitive topics.

  * These topics appear to a greater or lesser extent in the following
    threads:

    * Aris Reshapes the Legislative Process
    * No Punishment for Nominal Crimes
    * coherent vision for Agora Nomic as an independent
      policing/judiciary force
    * Discussion of Honor

  * Historical note: ais523 said the honour system used to be defined
    by a contract.

* There's discussion about relaxing the rules on officer reports in the
  thread "No Punishment For Nominal Crimes".

* Some emotions are shared on the thread "Distribution of Proposals
  8409-8430", after it's suggested Aris is submitting proposals for
  money. This leads to discussion of the benefits and downsides of
  offering rewards for proposals.

  * Aris later proposes to remove the AI multiplier from proposal
    rewards in the thread "Proposal Reward Trimming".

  * ATMunn cares about our mental and emotional help, and is there for
    us if we ever need someone to talk to.


# Miscellaneous

* Jason announces eir birthday and receives messages and coin grants.

* Some players object to R. Lee's Flappy Bird tournament.

* nch becomes Agora's first (to this Reportor's knowledge) Webmastor and
  publishes eir first report, Agora OnLine. Except it turns out the
  proposal adding the office may not have been properly distributed
  (see: "[Promotor] Corrections to Report of May 14"), so that might
  have been a dress rehearsal.

  Lime ribbon? R. Lee submits a proposal to make it so ("Proposal: Edit
  Lime") and there's discussion in the thread "Question About Lime
  Ribbons".

  this week. Threads: "Possible Second Distribution [Attn. Assessor]",

  Cards are earned, and receives comments, in the thread "Aris Reshapes the

* Aris submits two proposals to remove punishments for being stuck in an
  impractical or impossible situation. Thread: "New Defenses"

    idea I've ever had...?"; P.S.S. intends to prepare a draft soon.

  them. Thread: "DADA Soft Repeal"

    proposal gets enough votes to pass.


# Other proposals

* R. Lee proposes a new patent title, Terms of Service, for fun or
  impactful contracts. Subject: "Patent Title Proposal (just a fun one)"
