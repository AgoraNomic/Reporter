  distribution.

  "Election Time"

    * After 8406 was composed, proposal 8400 repealed Line-item Veto.

    and Treasuror instead. (8407)

# Culture and history

* R. Lee pledges a bounty for filling in all the gaps in the CFJ
  database in the years 2018 and 2019. Thread: "Pledge (attention COTC)"


# Rules questions

* Should a CFJ entangling facts normally irrelevant to the game with
  facts relevant to the game be judged IRRELEVANT? Discussion of CFJ
  3837 continues, including the intended vs. actual meaning of the CFJ
  statement.

* Can a player claim the same colour of glitter twice in a row for two
  separate instances of earning that colour of ribbon? The Herald opines
  yes. Thread: "Long Service Awards".

* Jason asks: Will the game of Agora ever end? Thread: "Is death
  inevitable?"

* Do actions and CFJs in Spanish work? ATMunn tries, and some past
  examples of use of languages other than English are discussed. Thread:
  "¿Puedo realizar acciónes en español?"

* Can confusion about ID numbers invalidate a proposal distribution? The
  Promoter opines it can't, in thread "Distribution of Proposals
  8388-8404".


# Auctions and zombies

* The Registrar raises a concern about "no stinking auction definitions"
  being adopted in the middle of a zombie auction. The Assessor says e
  is okay with holding off resolution of the proposal until auction
  winners have had a chance to claim their winnings. Thread: "a
  regulatory experiment (auctions)"

* The June zombie auction begins.


# Contracts

* Trigon circulates more drafts of the LoAFER contract for players who
  want to help officers keep accurate records, and solicits preferences
  from officers about how they would prefer messages requiring their
  attention to be marked.

* nch creates the Needlesly Abstract Exchange, a contract for trading,
  and players join.


# Honour, minor crimes; being nice to each other

* Some discussion of how seriously people take negative karma and
  punishment, and about treating each other well and how to handle
  sensitive topics.

  * These topics appear to a greater or lesser extent in the following
    threads:

    * Aris Reshapes the Legislative Process
    * No Punishment for Nominal Crimes
    * coherent vision for Agora Nomic as an independent
      policing/judiciary force
    * Discussion of Honor

  * Historical note: ais523 said the honour system used to be defined
    by a contract.

* There's discussion about relaxing the rules on officer reports in the
  thread "No Punishment For Nominal Crimes".


# Miscellaneous

* Jason announces eir birthday and receives messages and coin grants.

* Some players object to R. Lee's Flappy Bird tournament.

* nch becomes Agora's first Webmastor (to my knowledge) and publishes
  eir first report, Agora OnLine.

* Should being an author rather than a co-author also help someone get a
  Lime ribbon? R. Lee submits a proposal to make it so ("Proposal: Edit
  Lime") and there's discussion in the thread "Question About Lime
  Ribbons".

* The Promotor plans to do a second distribution this week. Threads:
  "Possible Second Distribution [Attn. Assessor]", "Administrative
  Guidance Regarding Distribution Timetables"

* On the thread "Aris Reshapes the Legislative Process", there's
  discussion about writing rules about player intent, in the context of
  banning "vote manipulation" to game Legislative Cards.

  * R. Lee proposes an amendment to the No Faking rule to not mention
    intent.

* Dave resumes discussion on "Agora Nomic as an independent
  policing/judiciary force". (Discussion started in the week
  2020-05-11..17.)


# Proposals on proposals

* Aris proposes several changes to the rules on proposals and how Legislative
  Cards are earned, and receives comments, in the thread "Aris Reshapes the
  Legislative Process"

* Aris proposes to make it free to pend proposals by certifying they are
  bug fixes, leading to discussion about whether this could generate
  CFJs, and a revision. Thread: "Certifiable Patches"

* Other(s) in thread(s): "Pending Pends".


# Other proposals

* Aris submits a proposal, drafted earlier, reforming Agora's academic
  system. Thread: "College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences"

  Pledge Amendments"

  some them which had been discussed in a somewhat earlier thread.) G.

  Prime Minister whenever the Executive Orders rule is changed. Thread:
  "Executive Expansion"

* "Transmutation": nch proposes a rule allowing a player to transmute
  any three Cards to a Card of a specified type. (Draft circulated last
  week.)

* P.S.S. starts a discussion on removing references to rule numbers in
  other rules, and submits proposals, in the thread "No More Numbers!".

  twice. Threads: "Aris Reshapes the Legislative Process", "Identity
  theft protection act v1.1"
