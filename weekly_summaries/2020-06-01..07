# Culture and History

* R. Lee pledges a bounty for filling in all the gaps in the CFJ
  database in the years 2018 and 2019. Thread: "Pledge (attention COTC)"


# Rules questions

* Should a CFJ entangling facts normally irrelevant to the game with
  facts relevant to the game be judged IRRELEVANT? Discussion of CFJ
  3837 continues, including the intended vs. actual meaning of the CFJ
  statement.

* Can a player claim the same colour of glitter twice in a row for two
  separate instances of earning that colour of ribbon? The Herald opines
  yes. Thread: "Long Service Awards".

* Jason asks: Will the game of Agora ever end? Thread: "Is death
  inevitable?"

* Do actions and CFJs in Spanish work? ATMunn tries, and some past
  examples of use of languages other than English are discussed. Thread:
  "¿Puedo realizar acciónes en español?"

* Can confusion about ID numbers invalidate a proposal distribution? The
  Promoter opines it can't, in thread "Distribution of Proposals
  8388-8404".


# Auctions and zombies

* The Registrar raises a concern about "no stinking auction definitions"
  being adopted in the middle of a zombie auction. The Assessor says e
  is okay with holding off resolution of the proposal until auction
  winners have had a chance to claim their winnings. Thread: "a
  regulatory experiment (auctions)"


# Contracts

* Trigon circulates more drafts of the LoAFER contract for players who
  want to help officers keep accurate records, and solicits preferences
  from officers about how they would prefer messages requiring their
  attention to be marked.

* nch creates the Needlesly Abstract Exchange, a contract for trading,
  and players join.


# Miscellaneous

* Jason announces eir birthday and receives messages and coin grants.

* Some players object to R. Lee's Flappy Bird tournament.

* nch becomes Agora's first Webmastor (to my knowledge) and publishes
  eir first report, Agora OnLine.

* Should being an author rather than a co-author also help someone get a
  Lime ribbon? R. Lee submits a proposal to make it so ("Proposal: Edit
  Lime") and there's discussion in the thread "Question About Lime
  Ribbons".

* The Promotor asks whether people would be interested in a second
  distribution this week. Thread: "Possible Second Distribution [Attn.
  Assessor]"


# Other Proposals

* Aris submits a proposal, drafted earlier, reforming Agora's academic
  system. Thread: "College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences"

* Bug fix: "Promise Powers Patch".

* R. Lee proposes some fixes to pledges. Thread: "[Proposal] Small
  Pledge Amendments"

* Aris proposes several changes to the rules on proposals, and receives
  comments, in the thread "Aris Reshapes the Legislative Process"

* Our H. Prime Minister proposes some new Executive Orders. (At least
  some them which had been discussed in a somewhat earlier thread.) G.
  responds with a proposal to allow any player to vacate the office of
  Prime Minister whenever the Executive Orders rule is changed. Thread:
  "Executive Expansion"

* "Transmutation": nch proposes a rule allowing a player to transmute
  any three Cards to a Card of a specified type. (Draft circulated last
  week.)

* P.S.S. starts a discussion on removing references to rule numbers in
  other rules, and submits proposals, in the thread "No More Numbers!".

* After others point out the Rulekeepor may be able to change rule ID
  numbers, Falsifian proposes to prevent that to close a possible scam.
