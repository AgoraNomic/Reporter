# Summary

Welcome Shy Owl, for real this time!

This week starts in silence, enough to make some wonder if the lists are
working.  A burst of activity happened with the first stone auction and
bugfixes on stone rules.  Some ratified mistakes get fixed and Falsifian
finally gets some coworkers at the Agoran Press, all the while potatoes
and fruits keep on coming.
