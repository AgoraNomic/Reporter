# Rulebending / victory

* Our benevolent dictator, G., awards emself the patent title Desultory
  Dictator, and rewards emself and eir conspirators with Black Ribbons
  and victory. Thread: "from the desk of Agora's most boring dictator"


# Academics

* Our Herald begins the process to award Cuddlebeam the degree Associate
  of Nomic Artistry for eir comics at https://imgur.com/a/VDAQaae (two
  of which are archived at
  https://github.com/AgoraNomic/Files/tree/master/cuddlebeam_thesis_2020-08-19).
  Thread: "Cuddlebeam Degree Intent"


# Rule questions

* Can a message to the discussion list be a public message if it's
  clearly intended to be? ATMunn tries, leading to a discussion with
  several different points raised. CFJ 3886; threads: "Public Message"
  and "[Arbitor] CFJ 3886 Assigned to Gaelan"; "mult-list test".

* When a judge extends eir case, is eir new deadline one week after the
  old deadline or after the time e filed the motion to extend? The
  Referee thinks it's the former. Thread: "[Finger Pointing] CFJ 3884
  Assigned to Aris"

* Is the Luner Laser Ranging experiment a forum? No: Aris judges CFJ
  3884 FALSE. The context is that G. tried to make it a Discussion forum
  with a Rulebending Form. (Compared to eir earlier draft judgement, it
  seems Aris dropped some text about the number of people needed to make
  a forum.) Thread: "CFJ 3884 Judged FALSE"

* When P.S.S. published an email with subject "[Herald] Matters of
  Honor" but with only a signature in the body, was that a
  self-ratifying Herald report? Probably not: G. circulates a draft
  judgment of CFJ 3885 finding FALSE, since the subject line was not
  part of the message

* Is a person who earns a Black Ribbon but already owns one eligible for
  Black Glitter? Thread: "from the desk of Agora's most boring dictator"


# Miscellaneous

* Aris petitions to acknowledge Jason's valuable technical work for
  Agora with a patent title, and possible titles are discussed. Thread:
  "Petition for Patent Title for Jason [attn. Herald]"

* A hint of trouble on the mailing list: P.S.S. didn't get a message
  Falsifian published. Thread: "[Attn. Treasuror, Distributor] Re: DIS:
  Re: OFF: [Tailor] Glitteral"
