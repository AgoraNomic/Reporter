# Summary

This week, our self-styled Desultory Dictator rewarded the cabal that put em in
power with victory and black ribbons (assuming a Rulebending form can cause
someone to win). Is this a sign that e is preparing to return power to the
Agoran populace? Or is it just the first of many boons from our Enlightened
Leader?

We also show our appreciation for Jason's helpful technical work with a
petition (by Aris) to award em a title (Roboticist General? Distributor
Honorary?), and for Cuddlebeam's comics with unanimous support for awarding
them the degree Associate of Nomic Artistry.

Progress continues on answering the important questions. No, the Lunar Laser
Ranging experiment is not a forum. No, accidentally sending an empty email with
a subject line indicating it's a report probably isn't a report of an empty
list.

# Rulebending / victory

* Our benevolent dictator, G., awards emself the patent title Desultory
  Dictator, and rewards emself and eir conspirators with Black Ribbons
  and victory. Thread: "from the desk of Agora's most boring dictator"


# Academics

* Our Herald begins the process to award Cuddlebeam the degree Associate
  of Nomic Artistry for eir comics at https://imgur.com/a/VDAQaae (two
  of which are archived at
  https://github.com/AgoraNomic/Files/tree/master/cuddlebeam_thesis_2020-08-19).
  Thread: "Cuddlebeam Degree Intent"


# Rule questions

* Can a message to the discussion list be a public message if it's
  clearly intended to be? ATMunn tries, leading to a discussion with
  several different points raised. CFJ 3886; threads: "Public Message",
  "[Arbitor] CFJ 3886 Assigned to Gaelan", "multi-list test".

* When a judge extends eir case, is eir new deadline one week after the
  old deadline or after the time e filed the motion to extend? The
  Referee thinks it's the former. Thread: "[Finger Pointing] CFJ 3884
  Assigned to Aris"

* Is the Luner Laser Ranging experiment a forum? No: Aris judges CFJ
  3884 FALSE. The context is that G. tried to make it a Discussion forum
  with a Rulebending Form. (Compared to eir earlier draft judgement, it
  seems Aris dropped some text about the number of people needed to make
  a forum.) Thread: "CFJ 3884 Judged FALSE"

* When P.S.S. published an email with subject "[Herald] Matters of
  Honor" but with only a signature in the body, was that a
  self-ratifying Herald report? Probably not: G. circulates a draft
  judgment of CFJ 3885 finding FALSE, since the subject line was not
  part of the message

* Is a person who earns a Black Ribbon but already owns one eligible for
  Black Glitter? Thread: "from the desk of Agora's most boring dictator"


# Miscellaneous

* Aris petitions to acknowledge Jason's valuable technical work for
  Agora with a patent title, and possible titles are discussed. Thread:
  "Petition for Patent Title for Jason [attn. Herald]"

* A hint of trouble on the mailing list: P.S.S. didn't get a message
  Falsifian published. Thread: "[Attn. Treasuror, Distributor] Re: DIS:
  Re: OFF: [Tailor] Glitteral"

* nix Points eir Finger at the Treasuror for a late report and promises Coins
  to anyone who publishes one. The current Treasuror publishes a report.

* nix cleans up a couple of old contracts. Thread: "@Notary Various Contract
  Clean-Up Actions"
