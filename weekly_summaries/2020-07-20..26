# Scams, rule questions, etc.

* nix identifies a bug in the new Talisman-based zombie system: anyone
  who controls a zombie "possesses more than one talisman" (including
  their own) and so can have both taken away from them with notice.
  Thread: "Talisman Revocation"

  * Jason submits a fix proposal in the thread "(another) talismans
    fix" (and revises it a couple of times).

* An email address sends some strange messages, beginning with a purported
  registration attempt borrowing other players' names. After some speculation,
  Gaelan reveals it's a bot e created.  Threads: "Registration" and "Coming
  clean"

  * For the messages, look for anything sent by "Greg P. Thomas II"
    (thomasgregoryp2 at gmail.com), and see also links Gaelan posted in the
    thread "Coming Clean" pointing to more generated text.

  * Were Greg's emails effectively sent by Gaelan? This is discussed in the
    context of finger-pointing in the threads "Registration" and "[Proposal]
    Contract-Specific Contracts"; the Referee finds that Gaelan was responsible
    for Greg's emails. It's also mentioned in the thread "Coming clean".

  * Jason tries to pend a proposal submitted by the bot, but it's decided (a)
    the message was too ambiguous to actually create a proposal, and (b) it
    wasn't sent by a person, so it wouldn't have worked anyway. ais523 wonders
    if a non-person can ever take an action by announcement. Thread:
    "[Proposal] Minion Plan"

  * There's some discussion about what an "organism" is (part of Agora's
    definition of "person"). Thread: "Registration"

* R. Lee tries to call "N CFJs" where "N is the number of CFJs that it would be
  reasonable for [em] to fully write out." The Arbitor says e considers it not
  to have worked, and there's other discussion. Thread: "@Arbitor Sillyness"

* Jason proposes a fix to a power escalation in the fee-based action
  rule text. Thread: "Fee-based method fix"


# Rule refactoring

* Jason circulates another draft of eir "Regulatory Instruments" proposal,
  which brings regulations into the "bodies of law" framework set up by Alexis
  earlier. Thread: "Regulatory Instruments vN+1"
