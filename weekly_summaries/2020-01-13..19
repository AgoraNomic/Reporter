# Voting

* Voting continues on Proposals 8280-8286. G. pleads for Rule 2597
  ("Line-item Veto") to not be repealed yet.


# Rules questions

* Debate continues on CFJ 3792, which is about whether whether the
  Promoter published a valid report. The arguments are generally about
  whether officers can fulfill their duties by publishing reports
  specifying past dates, but G. judges the CFJ FALSE on a technicality.
  In further discussion, Alexis asks for the judgement to be
  reconsidered. Threads: "[Arbitor] CFJ 3792 Assigned to G.", "CFJ 3792
  Judgement".

* Jason Cobb judges CFJ 3791, which is about whether a contract was
  successfully created, TRUE.

* Alexis starts a discussion of whether conditional actions like "If
  Rance's Master is set to me, I cause Rance to transfer all of eir
  liquid assets to Jason Cobb." work. This is branched from discussion
  of the January zombie auction.

  * twg argues the precedent in CFJ 1215 saying they don't work
    shouldn't apply here.

* Aris publishes a whimsical judgement of CFJs 3784 and 3785, about
  what a proposal that purports to transfer coins from itself does.
  There follows some debate about the judgement, with G. arguing that
  the judgment may be wrong. Thread: "CFJs 3784, 3785, and 3785.5
  judged FALSE".

* On messages becoming public due to being forwarded to a public forum:

  * G. judges CFJ 3790 FALSE: Jason Cobb did not cause the Officeholder
    of Comptrollor to be flipped by forwarding the H. ADoP's earlier
    message to a public forum.

  * Falsifian attempts to Declare Apathy by forwarding eir own earlier
    message declaring intent, but e messes up the intent wording
    (saying "with notice" rather than "without objection"). Falsifian
    withdraws eir CFJ about it, and Aris submits a replacement CFJ.
    Thread: "Apathy".

* G. calls a CFJ about whether e can earn Glitter for a ribbon-earning
  that is not their most recent. Thread: "income and [CFJ]"


# Culture

* Aris proposes to take on the task of suggesting recipients for
  back-awarding of Silver Quills for 2016, 2017 and 2018. Thread:
  "Back-Awarding of Silver Quills".


# High-level rule change discussions

* Alexis outlines a possible direction for the changing the rules that
  would "move us towards a more pragmatic model of law". Thread:
  "Proto-proto: Findings of Law & Fact".

* twg restarts discussion on Trigon's "Interesting Chambers" proposal
  by circulating an updated version. Thread: "Proto: Interesting
  Chambers v3". E later submits it in the thread "Proposal dump".

* Aris circulates an updated plan for "Administrative Law" including
  drafts of related proposals (thread: "[Drafts] Administrative Law"),
  then submits them along some others in the thread "Dumping More
  Proposals".


# Smaller proposals and other rule change discussions

* G. proposes a use for karma. Others critique the proposal. Thread:
  "[proposal] kamikaze".

* Gaelan sends a proto proposal that would give officers more voting
  power on proposals affecting rules that relate to them. Others
  critique the proposal. Thread: "Proto: Bureaucratic Power".

* G. proposes to increase the maximum voting strength. There has been
  discussion on this topic recently, including this week in the
  "[proposal] kamikaze" thread.

* Alexis proposes to make officers repsonsible for figuring out when
  players earn rewards. Thread: "Straw poll: officers responsible for
  rewards?".

  * In response, twg protos a couple of proposals along these lines. E
    publicly "warrents" that e did not intentionally include loopholes.

    * E calls a CFJ about whether eir warranty constitutes a pledge
      about the future, but withdraws it after Jason Cobb points out e
      already tried similar CFJ in the past (CFJ 3748).

  * A thread of the discussion turns to winning the game by flagrant
    rule violations.

  * G. recounts part of the story of how the Rule 2029, "Town
    Fountain", got passed, involving the power held by the Assessor.

* Gaelan volunteers to take the Notary office that would be added by
  Aris's "Contract Patency" proposal.

* Jason Cobb sends a proto-proposal fixing a possible bug in Rule 2160
  ("Deputisation"), leading to discussion about deputisation. Thread:
  "[Proto] Deputisation timeliness".

* Alexis sends a proto-proposal adding a notion of "default votes",
  making zombies endorse their masters by default, and removing zombies
  from quorum calculations. Thread: "[Proto] Zombie voting package".

* Alexis sends some proto-proposals and says e doesn't intend to submit
  them, and pledges to reward players whose proposals helped em receive
  a Lime ribbon.

* twg submits several proposals in the thread "Proposal dump".

* Aris promises that the proposals e has submitted are not part of a
  scam, and encourages twg, who has also submitted many proposals, to
  do the same. Thread: "Warranty".


# Offices

* G. points eir finger at the current Tailor, Nch, and promises eir
  vote to anyone who deputises to publish a Tailor's report. twg
  obliges by deputising as Tailor, and initiates an election. Threads:
  "finger-point", "[Deputy Tailor] Ribbon Bar", "Tailor Election".

  * The Referee levies a fine of 2 blots on Nch, making Nch the only
    person with blots.

* Alexis makes a bid for Referee, saying in eir election speech that e
  will use Summary Judgement capriciously and arbitrarily but not
  against anyone who votes for em. Thread: "Referee Election".

  * Eir attempt to initiate the election fails (e misremembered the
    rules) but the current Referee, twg, initiates the election for em
    and joins the race, giving a contrasting election speech.

* G. initiates an election for Herald, hoping to find someone else to
  take on the work. Alexis becomes a candidate. Thread: "Herald
  Election".


# January Zombie Auction

* The January zombie auction ends.

  * Jason Cobb points out that a bid by Gaelan was not sent to the
    public forum, so e beats Gaelan in the auction and the Registrar's
    end-of-auction email is erroneous. The Registrar sends an updated
    announcement.

* Gaelan calls a CFJ asking whether zombie auctions actually work.
  Thread: "[Registrar] End of January zombie auction" with various
  prefixes added to the subject line.

  * G. re-surfaces a thread from June 2019 in which the issue was
    discussed before. Thread: "Zombie auction fix".

  * This leads to some discussion of cases where the rules state that
    something CAN be done, but do not give a mechanism, whether
    by-announcement should be the default mechanism, and the history of
    regulated actions.


# Miscellaneous

* Aris asks about thesis expectations. Alexis suggests looking at past
  examples, and G. (technically on Monday January 20, so I'm stretching
  the scope of this document by a few minutes) posts some old criteria
  from 2003. Thread: "Theses in the Agoran Context: A Query".
