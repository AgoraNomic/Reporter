# Voting

* Voting continues on Proposals 8280-8286.


# Rules questions

* Debate continues on CFJ 3792, which is about whether whether the
  Promoter published a valid report. The arguments are generally about
  whether officers can fulfill their duties by publishing reports
  specifying past dates, but G. judges the CFJ FALSE on a technicality.
  In further discussion, Alexis asks for the judgement to be
  reconsidered. Threads: "[Arbitor] CFJ 3792 Assigned to G.", "CFJ 3792
  Judgement".

* Jason Cobb judges CFJ 3791, which is about whether a contract was
  successfully created, TRUE.


# Culture

* Aris proposes to take on the task of suggesting recipients for
  back-awarding of Silver Quills for 2016, 2017 and 2018. Thread:
  "Back-Awarding of Silver Quills".


# High-level rule change discussions

* Alexis outlines a possible direction for the changing the rules that
  would "move us towards a more pragmatic model of law". Thread:
  "Proto-proto: Findings of Law & Fact".


# Smaller proposals and other rule change discussions

* G. proposes a use for karma. Others critique the proposal. Thread:
  "[proposal] kamikaze".

* Gaelan sends a proto proposal that would give officers more voting
  power on proposals affecting rules that relate to them. Others
  critique the proposal. Thread: "Proto: Bureaucratic Power".

* G. proposes to increase the maximum voting strength. There has been
  discussion on this topic recently, including this week in the
  "[proposal] kamikaze" thread.

* Alexis proposes to make officers repsonsible for figuring out when
  players earn rewards. Thread: "Straw poll: officers responsible for
  rewards?".

  * In response, twg protos a couple of proposals along these lines. E
    publicly "warrents" that e did not intentionally include loopholes.

    * E calls a CFJ about whether eir warranty constitutes a pledge
      about the future, but withdraws it after Jason Cobb points out e
      already tried similar CFJ in the past (CFJ 3748).

  * A thread of the discussion turns to winning the game by flagrant
    rule violations.

  * G. recounts part of the story of how the Rule 2029, "Town
    Fountain", got passed, involving the power held by the Assessor.


# Offices

* G. points eir finger at the current Tailor, Nch, and promises eir
  vote to anyone who deputises to publish a Tailor's report. twg
  obliges by deputising as Tailor, and initiates an election. Threads:
  "finger-point", "[Deputy Tailor] Ribbon Bar", "Tailor Election".

  * The Referee levies a fine of 2 blots on Nch, making Nch the only
    person with blots.

* Alexis makes a bid for Referee, saying in eir election speech that e
  will use Summary Judgement capriciously and arbitrarily but not
  against anyone who votes for em. Thread: "Referee Election".

  * Eir attempt to initiate the election fails (e misremembered the
    rules) but the current Referee, twg, initiates the election for em
    and joins the race, giving a contrasting election speech.
