# Voting

* Proposals 8277-8279 are resolved. Only 8277 ("Minor Giveaway") is
  adopted.


# Proposal discussions

* Alexis starts a conversation about a possible big change: "...what if
  officers presumptively had the ability to rule on their areas of
  gamestate, in a more active manner than our ratification system?".
  Thread: "ratifying honour etc.".

  * G. lists some past conversations along similar lines.

  * Aris drafts a very brief new rule that would allow officers to
    issue binding memoranda. This leads to a lot of discussion:

    * There is discussion of whether it is too vague for an important
      area of the game, and whether memoranda would have power over
      CFJs, and whether that could cause a "constitutional crisis". G.
      cites an ancient scam called Lindrum World.

    * twg suggests a rewording involving re-using regulations.

    * G. gives some ideas, including one that would make only current
      officers' memoranda binding, making memoranda an election issue.

    * Aris posts an updated and expanded draft with a new subject line,
      "[Draft] Administrative Adjudication v2".

  * Alexis expands on their ideas, and comments on others' messages and
    possible ways forward, in a January 8 message [0].

* Branching off of the discussion Alexis started, Jason Cobb sketches a
  possible system of modules and dependencies between rules and
  modules. Thread: "ratifying honour, etc.".

* Gaelan proposes an annual two-week period for destructive scams,
  after which the state of the game is reset to what they were before
  the period. There's discussion of whether the reset would work, and
  of different implentations, like running a parallel nomic. Thread:
  "Proto: Fool Season".

* Gaelan assembles a document [1] tracking old proto-proposals that never
  got passed but look interesting. Thread: "Forgotten proto
  collection"; link:


# Minor proposals

* Alexis submits three proposals. The first broadens (or clarifies) the
  conditions for earning a Red Ribbon, and the aother two appear
  intended to give the Comptrollor more power by increasing the power
  of the "Line-item Veto" rule and preventing votes from being
  conditional on provisions of proposals being vetoed.

* In contrast to Alexis's proposals, Aris proposes to repeal the
  "Line-item Veto" rule.

* twg proposes to remove exponential decay of fugitives' blots, arguing
  it is no longer needed. Thread: "[Proposal] Blot Stabilisation".


# Rules questions

* Proposal 8277 is adopted. Its effect is unclear: see the thread
  "[Proposal] I'm curious if this version works" from earlier in
  December. The Treasuror gives eir opinion that the proposal did
  nothing, based on Aris's arguments from that thread.

* twg attempts to join a contract Gaelan proposad last week, leading to
  a CFJ and discussion about single-member contracts. Thread:
  "[Promotor] Distribution of Proposals 8277-8279"


# Miscellaneous

* Alexis unambiguously registers and again expresses interest in
  judging, especially a CFJ called by Aris about ratifying fora being
  public. (There was some uncertainty about whether e registered last
  week.)

* This month's zombie auction begins after the Registrar finishes
  resolving ambiguity about three instances of the master switch.


# Mailing list troubles

Context: certain messages sent in December may have failed to be
delivered to a significant number of players, causing them to not count
as messages sent via a public forum. The uncertainty over whether this
is true and which messages it affects results in some uncertainty about
the current gamestate.

* Falsifian notes a couple of messages e didn't receive. Thread: "[RWO]
  List Patch (attn. Arbitor)". Quazie notes as a GMail user e did get
  the messages.

* G. suggests officers individually decide how to resolve the ambiguity
  by ratifying their possibly-"false" reports with whatever is
  "fairest". Thread: "ratifying honour etc.".

* Falsifian withdraws eir proposal "Let's do this the hard way v1.1",
  as "out of touch with the latest work and suggestions".
