# Voting

* Proposals 8277-8279 are resolved. Only 8277 ("Minor Giveaway") is
  adopted.


# Rules questions

* Proposal 8277 is adopted. It says "I transfer 5 coins to each active
  player, in the order that they are listed in the most recent
  Registrar's Weekly Report.", and its effect is unclear. See the
  thread "[Proposal] I'm curious if this version works" from earlier in
  December. The Treasuror gives eir opinion that the proposal did
  nothing, based on Aris's arguments from that thread.


# Proposals

* Alexis submits three proposals. The first broadens (or clarifies) the
  conditions for earning a Red Ribbon, and the aother two appear
  intended to give the Comptrollor more power by increasing the power
  of the Line-Item veto rule and preventing votes from being
  conditional on provisions of proposals being vetoed.


# Miscellaneous

* Alexis unambiguously registers and again interest in judging,
  especially a CFJ called by Aris about ratifying fora being public.
  (There was some uncertainty about whether e registered last week.)

* This month's zombie auction begins after the Registrar finishes
  resolving ambiguity about three instances of the master switch.


# Mailing list troubles

Context: certain messages sent in December may have failed to be
delivered to a significant number of players, causing them to not count
as messages sent via a public forum. The uncertainty over whether this
is true and which messages it affects results in some uncertainty about
the current gamestate.

* Falsifian notes a couple of messages e didn't receive. Thread: "[RWO]
  List Patch (attn. Arbitor)". Quazie notes as a GMail user e did get
  the messages.

* G. suggests officers individually decide how to resolve the ambiguity
  by retifying their possibly-"false" reports with whatever is
  "fairest". Thread: "ratifying honour etc.".
