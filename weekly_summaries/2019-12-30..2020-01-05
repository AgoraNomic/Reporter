# Voting

* Voting continues on Proposals 8277-8279 (or possibly just 8278-8279
  if Proposal 8277 was successfully distributed during the mailing list
  trouble).


# Scams

* Gaelan submites an updated version of the precedence scam proposal e
  submitted last week. Thread: "[ATTN: promotor] ... Proposal:
  precedence scam?".


# Mailing list trouble

Context: certain messages sent in December may have failed to be
delivered to a significant number of players, causing them to not count
as messages sent via a public forum. The uncertainty over whether this
is true and which messages it affects results in some uncertainty about
the current gamestate.

* H. Distributor omd reports an approximate chronology of the recent
  mailing list trouble, and describes measures e has taken to improve
  the situation. Among other things, e wrote some new code to notify
  non-subscribers when eir messages are rejected and disabled
  subscription via agora-<listname>-subscribe@ aliases. Thread:
  "Pinpointing end of list outage (was BUS: Might as well try)".

* Falsifian attempts to help resolve ambiguities in the gamestate by
  announcing intent to flip some master switches to Agora and
  announcing eir resignation as Prime Minister.

* Falsifian objects to Aris's attempt to resolve the gamestate
  ambiguity by ratifying retroactive changes to the status of the lists
  as public fora, arguing that it might not work as intended. Thread:
  "[RWO] List Patch".

  * Aris calls a CFJ about it, and argument follows.

  * Alexis favours the case after registering.

* Falsifian submits (then revises) a proposal to fix some of the
  gamestate ambiguity piece-by-piece, instead of by retroactively
  ratifying that the messages in question were or were not sent via a
  public forum as the other attempts have done. Thread: "[Proposal]
  Let's do this the hard way."

* G. argues for ratifying that the messages in question happened.
  Thread: "rant".


# Miscellanous

* Jason Cobb publishes the first Full Logical Ruleset since October 15.

  * Ã˜rjan points out a formatting issue Jason Cobb's reports had in the
    past has re-occurred.

* Discussion of the MUD Aris created continues in the thread "[MUD] New
  Agoran MUD".

* Aris's computer is in for repairs until about the end of the week; e
  won't be working on the MUD or publishing Promotor reports until
  then. Thread: "[MUD] New Agoran MUD".

* Gaelan creates a contract allowing others to act on eir behalf to
  perform actions when e accidentally sends them to a discussion forum
  instead of a public forum. Thread: "[Promotor] Distribution of
  Proposals 8277-8279".

* Past player Alexis registers. Thread: "[RWO] List Patch (attn.
  Arbitor)".

* H. Arbitor G. does not plat to assign any CFJs before the holiday
  ends, and suggests we may want to return to "the old holiday rules"
  which presumably would suspend duties during the holidays. Thread:
  "[RWO] List Patch (attn. Arbitor)".
