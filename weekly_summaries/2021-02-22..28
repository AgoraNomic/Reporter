# Summary

This week: a promising attempt by G. to win by paradox, and an informal
contest to predict the time CFJ 4000 will be called.

Fairly quiet besides that. A bunch of fix-up proposals are submitted.


# Voting

* Voting continues on Proposals 8541-8543:

  * Add some missing methods. (8541)

  * Make bored stones more likely to escape. (8542)

  * Add a delay between economic victory and destruction of assets.
    (8543)


# Miscellaneous

* G. announces an informal contest in honour of CFJ 3900, called this
  week. The challenge: predict when CFJ 4000
  will be called. Thread: "Judiciary Four Thousand (contest)"

  * Players submit guesses. Falsifian draws a CFJ number timeline with
    an awful shell command.

* The Registrar addresses a report error pointed out earlier by Jason
  and G., about ancient deregistration dates, in the thread
  "[Registrar] Monthly Report", and gets some help from G.


# Proposals

Many fix-up proposals this week, some of which the Promotor certified
at the end of the week.

* There's discussion on a proposal from Murphy in the thread "Clarify
  dependent actions".

* Aris proposes to lower-case some CANs in the thread "Uncanny Fixes",
  leading to discussion on one of the changes and suggestions about
  another.

* Jason submits a proposal to prevent Emergency Regulations from
  changing who holds Prime Minister or Speaker, based on G.'s recent
  scam. Thread: "[proposal] ER Patch"

* G. submits a proposal to remove left-over language about talismans.
  Thread: "[proposal] talisman bugfix"


# Rule questions and strange behaviour

* Was Murphy able to replace "Motions of confidence" with "Motions of
  no confidence" by cleaning (rule 2221)? Jason calls CFJ 3900; thread:
  "Resolving cleaning".

* Did ATMunn successfully repeal G.'s emergency regulations last month?
  Yes: Falsifian judges CFJ 3899 TRUE, adding some detail to last
  week's draft judgement.

* What happens if a promise creates and cashes a copy of itself, in an
  attempt to change a vote infinitely many times? G. tries it, and
  argues for a CFJ to be judged PARADOXICAL. Thread: "A vote, a
  promise, and a [cfj]"


# Economy

* The second February Victory Auction begins, with a single lot: one
  Victory Card.
