# Summary

Read this week's episode of the Speaker Show for an exclusive Agoran
interview! Only on the OFF mailing list.

A lot of cleaning up this week: we said goodbye to the honourable old
Karma system; started voting on the end of zombies and of a
dictatorship; saw the partial demise of the Dragon Corporation; and saw
a draft proposal to repeal the Statutory Instrumentation framework.

We also began voting on Aris's much-anticipated more-inclusive "person"
definition, along with a few other proposals. JTAC intends to enact eir
promised Referee regulations, and a new election for Prime Minister has
begun.

Cuddlebeam continues energetically working toward victory, with an
attempted scam and some more straightforward but effective trading.
Cuddlebeam's liar's paradox attempt from last week is judged not to
have worked.

Get ready for Read the Ruleset Week! Jason circulated some unofficial
draft rules.

# Tricky behaviour, and understanding the rules

* Cuddlebeam attempts a scam: transferring 0 cards from other players
  to emself, and having 0 round up to the nearest natural number, 1.
  Others argue that it doesn't work, because 0 is a natural number and
  there's no method to transfer other people's things. Thread: "humble
  agoran farmer is One with Nothing"

* Jason judges CFJ 3894 FALSE: Cuddlebeam's statement last week "This
  statement is a lie and I intend to mislead with it." was a lie, but e
  did not intend to mislead with it. Thread: "[Arbitor] CFJ 3894
  Assigned to Jason"

  Thread: "[Rulekeepor] Draft RTRW Rules"

  "locker" contracts, to enable rule-defined theft, leading to some
  comments and debate. Thread: "[proto] Executors"

  changes, and receives comments. Thread: "[Proto] The Great Rollback"

* Jason proposes to create a delay between when a player Takes Over the
  Economy and when resources are destroyed. Thread: "VP Reset Delay"

  comment. Thread: "[Proto] RWO for all"


# Contracts

* With corporate proposals from Aris, Dragon Corporation's members
  liquidate it and then destroy it and its subsidiary contract, Dragon
  QuickExchange. The contracts have been inactive, and the recent
  economic reset resolves the question of what to do withoutstanding
  Dragon QuickExchange credits. Thread: "[Dragon] Liquidation"

  * Aris changes eir mind later about destroying the Dragon
    Corporation. It looks like the contract will stick around for a
    while, emptied of resources.

  SEAMSTRESS. Thread: "SEAMSTRESS Amendment"
