# Summary

A relatively quiet week.

Voting began for our next prime minister, with four candidates vying for
the spot. The key to victory may be paying the appropriate bribes.
(Fortunately, voters have made this straightforward by setting forth
clear terms for bribing em.)

Some proposals are adopted, but nothing exciting. ATMunn forgets eir
birthday, and proposes a consolation prize.


# Voting

* The decisions to adopt Proposals 8500-8503 are resolved. All four are
adopted:

  * Shorten the deadline for the Assessor to issue a humiliating
    reminder when voting fails to reach quorum. (8502)

  * Various clarifications and fixes. (8500, 8501, 8503)

* Voting begins for the next Prime Minister.

  * The candidates (so far): ATMunn, Gaelan, Murphy, nix.

  * Murphy posts a complicated conditional vote incentivising the
    candidates to give em stuff, starting a trend. Thread: "Prime
    Minister vote"


# Miscellaneous

  Re: OFF: [Arbitor] CFJ 3883 ...", "CFJ 3884 Assigned to Shelvacu",

  coins. Thread: "[Proposal] i missed my agoran birthday :("
