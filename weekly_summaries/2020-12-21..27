# Summary

This week, Publius Scribonius Scholasticus announced that e plans to
deregister next weekend. E has been an active player since e most
recently registered in March. E ran the 2020 Birthday Tournament
(theme: Diplonomic), and currently serves as our Herald, Referee and
Tailor. E says e will eventually return, but for now, e will be missed!

A new addition to the Registrar's report shows that the dates Agora's
current players first joined the game vary widely --- from our most
recent registrations lucidiot and Shy Owl, to Murphy, for whom the
exact date is lost in the mists of time.

A quiet week, overall. The phasings-out of zombies and G.'s barrels
game continued. We heard from the mysterious maintainer of our "Tue",
our backup backup list.
