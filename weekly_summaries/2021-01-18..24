# Players

* Slam_Joe_Jr_Supreme joins the game.


# Voting and elections

* Voting continues on the Referee election. Thread: "[ADoP] Voting for
  Referee"

* Voting begins on Proposals 8530 and 8531.

  * 8530 repeals Agora's Karma system (Rule 2510).

    * Repealing Karma has been proposed at least twice in this
      Reportor's memory: in April 2019, during a period when many
      officers were empty; and then once again somewhat more recently,
      because it wasn't being used much.

  * 8531 allows former persons to hold Patent Titles, and restores
    titles to any such who lost them. (The definition of "person"
    sometimes changes.)


# Rule questions and strange behaviour

* Can ID numbers actually be assigned to rules? Thread: "[CFJ] Rule
  Numbers"

* G. tells an obvious lie and purports to intend to mislead us all.
  Perhaps e is implying a question: did e violate Rule 2471 (No
  Faking)?


# Dictatorship

G. currently rules us via Rulebending.

* G. corrects an earlier accounting error using eir powers. Thread:
  "(@Treasuror) [Emergency] unfinished business"

* G. submits a new version of eir proposal to repeal the Rulebending
  which enables eir dictatorship and fix related problems. This time e
  includes an addition to the Royal Parade. Thread: "proposal:
  de-dictatorship"


# Miscellaneous

* Aris submits some historical corrections to the Herald. Thread:
  "Correcting Our History"

* Aris drafs a proto to remove Summary Judgement, describing it as
  overpowered and rarely used. Thread: "[Proto] Justice for All"

* Cuddlebeam tries taking advantage of potential future changes in the
  game by writing messages that do nothing now but may later have been
  considered to have done something. Thread: "humble agoran farmer
  greets Nietzsche"

* Ubercrow, recently joined, deputises for Tailor, recently vacated.
  (Though e may have forgotten to say e's deputising.) Thread:
  "Ubercrow: Tailor's Weekly Glitter Report"

* Jason disolves the AAA contract. Thread: "[AAA] Dissolution"

* Cuddlebeam does some business, including buying the Concentration
  Stone from ATMunn. Threads: "humble agoran farmer does business",

  humble agoran farmer"

  non-festive players ineligible to support or object to emergency
  regulations or impeachments. Thread: "[proto] Festival strengthening"
