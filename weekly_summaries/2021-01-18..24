# Players

* Slam_Joe_Jr_Supreme joins the game. (Joe for short.)


# Voting and elections

* Voting continues on the Referee election. Thread: "[ADoP] Voting for
  Referee"

* Voting begins on Proposals 8530 and 8531.

  * 8530 repeals Agora's Karma system (Rule 2510).

    * Repealing Karma has been proposed at least twice in this
      Reportor's memory: in April 2019, during a period when many
      officers were empty; and then once again somewhat more recently,
      because it wasn't being used much.

  * 8531 allows former persons to hold Patent Titles, and restores
    titles to any such who lost them. (The definition of "person"
    sometimes changes.)


# Rule questions and strange behaviour

* Can ID numbers actually be assigned to rules? Thread: "[CFJ] Rule
  Numbers"

* G. tells an obvious lie and purports to intend to mislead us all.
  Perhaps e is implying a question: did e violate Rule 2471 (No
  Faking)?


# Dictatorship

G. currently rules us via Rulebending.

* G. corrects an earlier accounting error using eir powers. Thread:
  "(@Treasuror) [Emergency] unfinished business"

* G. submits and pends a new version of eir proposal to repeal the
  Rulebending which enables eir dictatorship and fix related problems.
  This time e includes an addition to the Royal Parade. Thread:
  "proposal: de-dictatorship"


# Proposals

* Justice:

  * Aris drafts versions of a proto to remove Summary Judgement,
    describing it as overpowered and rarely used. Thread: "[Proto]
    Justice for All"

  * G. submits a proposal that allows paying to give other players
    blots. Thread: "[proposal] unofficial injustice"

* Jason drafts a proposal that strengthens Festivals by making
  non-festive players ineligible to support or object to emergency
  regulations or impeachments. Thread: "[proto] Festival strengthening"

* Aris submits a new draft of a proposal to redefine "person". Thread:
  "[Proto] We the People"

  * Falsifian wonders whether the proposed definition rules out
    "not-very-smart" computer programs.

* G. submits revised versions of eir proposal to replace the zombie
  rules. Thread: "third level Turn Undead"

  * There's some discussion about a requirement to send deregistration
    intents to a player's email address: can we tell whether it was
    done? G. replaces the requirement with a SHOULD, and allows the
    deregistration to be blocked with three objections, in eir final(?)
    version "Turn Undead v2".


# Miscellaneous

* Aris submits some historical corrections to the Herald. Thread:
  "Correcting Our History"

* Cuddlebeam tries taking advantage of potential future changes in the
  game by writing messages that do nothing now but may later have been
  considered to have done something. Thread: "humble agoran farmer
  greets Nietzsche"

* Ubercrow, recently joined, deputises for Tailor, recently vacated.
  (Though e may have forgotten to say e's deputising.) Thread:
  "Ubercrow: Tailor's Weekly Glitter Report"

* Jason disolves the AAA contract. Thread: "[AAA] Dissolution"

* Cuddlebeam does some business, including buying Victory Cards and
  buying the Concentration Stone from ATMunn.

  - Some of it turns out to have failed because CuddleBeam had eir
    assets stored in eir "locker" contract. E still prebably gets the
    Concentration Stone; Jason points out ATMunn transferred it
    unconditionally.

  - Threads: "humble agoran farmer does business", "humble agoran
    farmer does more business", "backroom dealings with a humble agoran
    farmer", "humble agoran farmer does even more business", "humble
    agoran farmer believes in safety"

* Aris donates a pendant to JTAC since "e's had a lot of good ideas".
  Thread: "A Gift for JTAC"
