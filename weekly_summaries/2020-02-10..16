  few weeks. Thread: "since we're doing this now"


# Voting and elections

* New officer elections:

  * The Rulekeepor initiates an election for Rulekeepor in the thread
    "[Rulekeepor] Election", and says e is willing to stay or go.

  * Elections for for Prime Minister and Notary are initiated in the
    thread "Election Intents".

  * Alexis also announces intent to initiate an election for Assessor,
    saying e is "dissatisfied with the sparse content of resolutions",
    leading to a discussion on the contents and formatting of Assessor
    reports. Thread: "Election Intents"

  * Gaelan says e may take Rulekeepor. Thread: "Election Intents"

* The ADoP initiates decisions to select the winners of the elections
  for Referee and Registrar. Thread: "[ADoP] Election voting opens"

* Proposals 8308-8321 are resolved, except that 8317 was not validly
  distributed. Adopted are some fixes and cleanups, and Proposal 8320,
  which allows the Promotor to set proposal chambers when they're not
  set. Thread: "[Assessor] Resolution of Proposals 8308-8321"

  * The Promotor takes advantage of eir new power from Proposal 8320.
    Thread: "[Promotor] Ministerial Referrals"

  * Falsifian attempts to claim a Red Ribbon, prompting a CFJ about
    whether eir Proposal 8308 changed a rule.

* Voting begins on a new round of proposals. Thread: "[Promotor]
  Distribution of Proposals 8322-3541"

  * These include some fixes and clarifications, not listed here, as
    well as:

    * Securing Ribbon ownership ("Secure Ribbons")

      * twg laments the possible loss of such a juicy [low-power] scam
        target. Jason suggests making black ribbons an exception, so
        they can still be targetted by low-power scams.

    * An increase to the victory fee to a median of a vote ("Inflation
      Vote")

    * Triggering of temporary rules designed to lead to rules questions
      ("Attempted cleanup, Blink test v1.2")

    * Making it so persons remain persons after death ("The Eternal
      Spirit")

    * Rescheduling this year's Read the Ruleset Week ("RtRW
      Reschedule")

    * Protection of players from losing their white ribbon power while
      they are zombies ("No looting white ribbons")

    * Empowering the Notary to clean up obsolete pledges ("Promissory
      cleanliness")

    * Increasing the Speaker's and Prime Minister's voting advantages
      ("Meaningful extra votes")

    * Destroying a victor's remaining Coins after a fee-based victory
      ("Meaningless extra coins")

    * A re-submission of Alexis's "Support of the Person" proposal.

      * twg argues for a review of the current Agoran Consent
        thresholds before adopting it.

  * The Promotor accidentally assigns some of the proposals numbers
    35XX instead of 83XX, then makes a second mistake and apologises,
    expresses embarassement, and transfers some Coins and karma to
    other players. Other players reassure em.


# Proposals, drafts and discussions

* Discussion continues on what should happen when someone wins through
  a High Score like win, like paying 1,000 Coins to win. Thread: "[Attn
  Promotor] Four proposals"

* Discussion continues on Murphy's economy proto-proposal in thread
  "[proto] Standard Model of Agoran Economics".

* Proposal submission etiquette: when re-submitting proposals, the

  number. Thread: "Question for the promotor"

* Murphy works on eir proposal to clarify ADoP duties in the thread
  "[Attn Promotor] Four proposals"

* Murphy proposes to clarify the rule for determining quorum. Thread:
  "[attn Promotor] Proposals: Clarify quorum"

* Discussion continues on officers issuing some sort of memoranda.
  Gaelan submits a new proposal, which leads to discussion on calling
  CFJs for undisputed questions. Thread: "[attn: promotor] Re: BUS: Re:
  DIS: PSA: Online ruleset viewer"

* Alexis resubmits (rather, submits a proposal identical to) eir
  Support of the Person proposal. It was previously rejected, but e
  submitted 11th-hour arguments which voters may not have had time to
  consider. Thread: "Last minute proposals"

* Alexis submits a proposal that makes it possible for a Laureled Prime
  Minister to either appoint emself Speaker or decline the office.

  aspects of an instrument as defined by Rule 2140. Thread: "Is
  interpretation substantive?"

  for use in contracts. Thread: "[Proposal] Blots here! Come get your
  Blots!"


# History

  archives", touching on the history and current use of the CFJ
  archives.

* Murphy sets up eir home server to back up the three main Agora lists
  monthly. Thread: "The Very Worst Thing That Could Possibly Happen
  (Attn. Distributor)"

  thread "[Reporter] Some questions, some thoughts, and a proposed
  newsletter" reported under the Miscellaneous section below.


# Rules questions

* Discussion continues on whether Agora is still a contract, after
  Cuddle Beam pointed out last week that this may interact badly with
  the new notion of "visible" and "invisible" contracts. Cuddle Beam
  calls a CFJ. Thread: "humble agoran farmer makes Agora visible"

* G. calls a CFJ on whether Proposal 8311 removes officers' obligations
  to grant rewards for events from before its adoption. Thread: "[cfj]
  double payments"

* Jason raises a question: what would happen if a proposal were passed
  where the reward calculation results in a negative number? The answer
  seems to be that nothing would happen since there's no concept of
  granting a negative asset.

* twg calls a CFJ about whether a proposal with a title consisting of a
  sequence of Unicode characters that looks like "Judicial Jocularity
  Act" is in fact titled "Judicial Jocularity Act", partly in an effort
  to create a long subject line. Thread: "[another CFJ] Re: [Proposal]
  Re: DIS: Re: BUS: [CFJ] [attn Rulekeepor] Re: BUS: [attn: Tailor] Re:
  OFF: [Assessor] Resolution of Proposals 8308-8321"

* G. judges CFJ 3795 FALSE: sending a message to yourself and then
  forwarding it to a public forum doesn't make it so that you published
  it at the original time you sent it to yourself.

* Discussion of using one apology for multiple offenses, or
  re-publishing an apology multiple times to expunge more blots, in the
  thread "Missed report".


# Zombies

Some context: zombie auctions are broken. The February zombie auction
might not have been successfully initiated. See CFJ 3793, and notes in
last week's summary.

* Ways to fix zombie auctions:

  * Alexis starts a discussion on ways to fix zombie auctions, and
    possibly redo or remove the auction rules. Thread: "Fixing zombie
    auctions"

  * Murphy submits a proposal to fix them using a change to Rule 2549,
    "Auction Initiation". A discussion follows on whether that rule has
    the power needed to do that. Thread: "[attn Promotor] Proposal: Fix
    Auctions"

  * Falsifian submits a proposal involving increasing the power of the
    Auction rules. Alexis says it lacks a mechanism by which Agora
    transfers the auctions. Thread: "[proto] Fix zombie auctions"

* The Referee finds that Jason did not break the rules by bidding more
  money than e had in the February zombie auction. Murphy submits a
  proposal to clarify the rule. Thread: "[Registrar] February zombie
  auction status"

* The Registrar drafts a message that would attempt to officially
  handle the end of the auction while covering three possible states
  the auction could be in. Thread: "[draft] [Registrar] End of February
  zombie auction, if it exists"

* Warrigal drafts a contract which would allow zombies to be traded.
  Thread: "Proto-contract: the Zombie Market"

* As anticipated, Judge Alexis finds that zombie auctions are broken in
