# Scams, rule questions, etc.

* CAN we send public messages? Yes (but the judge of CFJ 3869
  accidentally judges it FALSE instead of TRUE).

* There's discussion about Agora's definition of "person" and plural
  collectives in the thread "Badge Problems".

* Are a contract's full provisions "publicly available" if one of the
  provisions refers to "a document that G. has previously published that
  has the SHA-256 hash ..."? Thread: "But I Won't Do That"

* Did Trigon's attempt to neutralise the "DISCLAIMER: There are no game
  actions in this message." added to eir signature by putting it in its
  own "document" work? P.S.S. finds that it did, because Trigon's intent
  was clear. This is CFJ 3870.


# Regulations

* The Promotor circulates draft regulations about proposal formatting
  and about pending proposals with support. Thread: "Request for
  Comments: Two Administrative Regulations"

* The Treasuror announces intent to promulgate auction regulations which
  e circulated earlier. Thread: "Intent to promulguate auction
  regulations"
