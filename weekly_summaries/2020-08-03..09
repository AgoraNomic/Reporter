# Summary

Welcome Shelvacu! Our new compatriot enters with a splash, with a bold
claim that it is already eir birthday. Did it work? Tune in next week to
find out!

G. publishes the MYSTERY DOCUMENT that eir proposal will enact, and
players vote FOR it so they can be Rulebenders.

Congratulations to this year's Birthday Tournament Champions Jason, G.
and ATMunn.

CFJ 3869 affirms that we CAN send public messages (phew!) but another
scary prospect is raised: we (most of us) might be using Ratification
Without Objection incorrectly! In lighter news, Trigon continues to fend
off attempts to hijack eir messages by buying signature space.

New processes were tested this week: our first successful Indictment
concluded, and the first zombie auction under the new Talisman rules for
zombies began.


# Registration

* New player Shelvacu (or Shel) Registers. In the same message, e
  announces eir Agoran Birthday, leading to CFJ 3873 and debate. Thread:
  "I wish to register"


# Victory and culture

* The winners of this year's Birthday Tournament are awarded the title
  Champion: ATMunn, G. and Jason.


# Miscellaneous

* G. publishes THE MYSTERY DOCUMENT, which says what eir proposal 8483
  will do: people who voted FOR will be titled Rulebenders and (with
  G.'s blessing) have the ability to have any document take effect (at
  power 1?) except certain effects are ruled out. Thread: "Publication
  of potential rule change"

  * Some players change their votes. Attempts are made to cast
    conditional votes that only evaluate to FOR if the proposal would
    have passed anyway.

  * R. Lee makes light of it in the thread "Lets see if you can do this
    every week".

* The August zombie auction begins. This is the first zombie auction
  since the auctions rules were substantially shortened by Proposal
  8407. (It's not the first auction under the new rule, though. The
  second Victory Auction concluded this week.)


# Scams, rule questions, etc.

See also: Registration (when a player first registers, is it immediately
eir Agoran Birthday?).

* CAN we send public messages? Yes. (But the judge of CFJ 3869
  accidentally assigns the wrong judgement the first time.)

* There's discussion about Agora's definition of "person" and plural
  collectives in the thread "Badge Problems".

* Are a contract's full provisions "publicly available" if one of the
  provisions refers to "a document that G. has previously published that
  has the SHA-256 hash ..."? The consensus seems to be: yes. Thread:
  "But I Won't Do That"

* Did Trigon's attempt to neutralise the "DISCLAIMER: There are no game
  actions in this message." added to eir signature by putting it in its
  own "document" work? P.S.S. finds that it did, because Trigon's intent
  was clear. This is CFJ 3870.

* Jason proposes to remove the part about a "scope" in the rule about
  ratification without objection, and suggests recent attempts may have
  failed because no "scope" was specified. Thread: "RWO fix"

* Discussion continues on whether Proposal 8486 correctly fixes an
  escalation bug in R2579 (Fee-based Actions) in the thread "Fee-based
  method fix".


# Regulations

* The Promotor circulates draft regulations about proposal formatting
  and about pending proposals with support. Thread: "Request for
  Comments: Two Administrative Regulations"

* The Treasuror promulgates the first auction regulations, having
  previously circulated drafts and doing test runs via the Victory
  Auctions. Thread: "Intent to promulguate auction regulations"


# Miscellaneous

* Our first functional Indictment under Rule 2619 concludes. R. Lee is
  fined one blot for failing to honour eir pledge to grant Victory Cards
  to G. after their recent scam failed. Thread: "Voting on the
  Indictment of R. Lee"
