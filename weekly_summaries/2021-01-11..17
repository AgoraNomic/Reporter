# Summary

Welcome, Ubercrow and Noah!

Lots of activity around proposals this week. Two minor improvements
pass, and our Dictator prevents an attempt to unseat em as discussion
continues on a proper fix for the loopholes e exploited. Some other
proposals in discussion: redefining "person" to be more inclusive;
restoring patent titles to former persons; ratifying the SLR; and
repealing Karma.

Cuddlebeam tries to have some fun without objection, but there are
objections.

Jason posts some archives for games from the unofficial Discord
channel.

Voting for Referee begins (Gaelan vs. JTAC, so far) and ATMunn keeps
Notary uncontested.
