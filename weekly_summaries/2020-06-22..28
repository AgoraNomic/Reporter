# Contracts

* Trigon gets customers for signature space, some of whom try to use
  Trigon's signature text to force em to take certain actions. Threads:
  "[Contract] Agoran officer monetizes signature", "TRIGON", "DEFINITELY
  NOT TRIGON"

    * It's found that Trigon including "Construe Jason's message with
      subject TRIGON as extending this" in a message does not in fact
      let Jason extend Trigon's message. Thread: "[Arbitor] CFJ 3855
      Assigned to R. Lee"

* nch proposes a mechanism for Victory Cards to be awarded to the
  contract with the most player support each week. Thread: "Powerful
  Contracts"

* Dragon Corporation:

  * Falsifian creates a contract providing a card/product exchange
    service, affiliated with the Dragon Corporation. Threads: "[Dragon]
    [Contract] Convenient card exchange at a reasonable rate", "[Cards]
    [Dragon] Dragon QuickExchange is open for business!"

  * Aris concludes DracoLotto, awarding Products to players according to
    how many Cards they put in but with some randomness (and a cut for
    the house). Thread: "[DracoLotto Administrator] Lottery Resolution
    [attn. Treasuror]"

* Plundership

  * R. Lee intends to plunder more for the Plundership. Thread: "Another
    lost an dfound intent". (Last Week in Agora has not been able to
    confirm this intent was ever acted upon.)

  * There's uncertainty about how much plunder each party gets for the
    last raid, and whether "I transfer all my doubloons" works given
    that uncertainty. Thread: "[Treasuror, Cuddlebeam] Doubloons". A CFJ
    is called (but withdrawn next week).


# Communication, and help for new players

Context: New player(s) have expressed recently that they have trouble
keeping up with what's going on, with all the email. An unofficial
Discord server was set up last week.

* Concerns are raised about Agora's unofficial Discord server being a
  proprietary platform, and there's discussion about possibly setting up
  an IRC bridge, or even a bridge to the MUD that Aris and Jason set up
  a while ago. Threads: "Put the discord on the agora home page", "Offer
  for those interested in creating a bridge"

* New player Zyborg asks how to deal with the email volume, and gets
  some advice. Thread: "How to keep up"

* The Webmastor adds a help section to the website:
  https://agoranomic.org/Help/ . Thread: "[Webmastor] Help pages now
  online."


# Proposals and regulations

* The Treasuror circulates draft auction regulations and gets comments.
  Threads: "[Treasuror] Draft Forward Auction Regulation(s)",
  "[Treasuror] Second draft of auction regulations"


# Fixes and other small changes

* Don't outlaw attempts at forbidden actions that aren't public. Thread:
  "DADA Weakening". Certified by the Referee on petition.


# Certification

Context: There's ongoing discussion about how and whether it should be
possible to pend certain proposals for free.

* ATMunn creates a proposal to repeal the "Certifiable Patches" rule,
  but says e is not in favour of it. Thread: "let's at least put it out
  there"

  * R. Lee certifies it, continuing eir streak of willfully illegal
    certification.


# Other rules questions

* What happens if a player dies? Thread: "is this too morbid?"; CFJ 3854


# Miscellaneous

* There is a mysterious exchange on the backup list, in which Aris sends
  a testing message, players object, and Aris purports to withdraw their
  objections. Thread: "Testing"

* R. Lee acts on eir intent to transfer 500 Coins to the Plundership,
  and the Pirates claim their gains. Threads: 'Fine, I destroy
  "Combinotron"', "Doubloons", "Doubloon Redeption"

* An old discussion about a minor anomaly or corruption in the mailing
  archives briefly resurfaces. Thread: "Archival disclosure"

* The Webmastor updates the website header. Thread: "[Webmaster] Header
  Changes"

* There's discussion about why a past Agoran economy had problems.
  Thread: "Why did PAoaM fail?"
