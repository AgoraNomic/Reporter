# Exile scam

nch and R. Lee begin an attempted scam: to have a player repeatedly
exiled and then re-registered, collecting welcome packages in between.
Since exiling must be done with 7 days notice, they are forced to give a
hint about their plans ahead of time by announcing a deregistration
intent. This starts a race to patch the bug before they can exploit it
--- the voting period for a proposal is also 7 days.

Timeline (UTC):

* 2020-06-23 02:37: nch announces intent 36 times to deregister R. Lee,
  starting the clock.

* 2020-06-23 02:38: Aris submits a proposal to patch the bug. Thread:
  "[Proposal] Welcome Package Patch"

* 2020-06-23 02:39: The Treasuror certifies the proposal. Thread:
  "certifying"

  (This leads to a Finger Pointing and debate about whether it met the
  conditions for certification.)

* 2020-06-23 02:40: The Promotor (again Aris) distributes it as Proposal
  8458, starting a second 7-day interval.

  Depending on how quickly the Assessor acts 7 days from now, and how
  voting for the proposal goes, the scammers may have a window as short
  as three minutes long between when R. Lee can be exiled and when the
  proposal can be adopted.

* 2020-06-23 02:51: Jason begins a motion of no confidence. Thread:
  "MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE"

  Prime Minister nch is one of the scammers.


# Mysteries

* Someone anonymously posts a message claiming to be a player and voting
  for a proposal. Thread: "Vote on P8442"; CFJ 3857. A player petitions
  em to reveal eir identity but e refuses. (Next week, Jason reveales
  that e was em.)

  * R. Lee submits proposals that would create severe consequences if
    the player did not reveal eir identity, but withdraws them. Thread:
    "[Proposal] Anonymity Busting"

* There is a mysterious exchange on the backup list, in which Aris sends
  a testing message, players object, and Aris purports to withdraw their
  objections. Thread: "Testing"


# Contracts

* Trigon gets customers for signature space, some of whom try to use
  Trigon's signature text to force em to take certain actions. Threads:
  "[Contract] Agoran officer monetizes signature", "TRIGON", "DEFINITELY
  NOT TRIGON"

    * It's found that Trigon including "Construe Jason's message with
      subject TRIGON as extending this" in a message does not in fact
      let Jason extend Trigon's message. Thread: "[Arbitor] CFJ 3855
      Assigned to R. Lee"

* nch proposes a mechanism for Victory Cards to be awarded to the
  contract with the most player support each week. Thread: "Powerful
  Contracts"

* Dragon Corporation:

  * Falsifian creates a contract providing a card/product exchange
    service, affiliated with the Dragon Corporation. Threads: "[Dragon]
    [Contract] Convenient card exchange at a reasonable rate", "[Cards]
    [Dragon] Dragon QuickExchange is open for business!"

  * Aris concludes DracoLotto, awarding Products to players according to
    how many Cards they put in but with some randomness (and a cut for
    the house). Thread: "[DracoLotto Administrator] Lottery Resolution
    [attn. Treasuror]"

* Plundership

  * R. Lee acts on eir intent to transfer 500 Coins to the Plundership,
    the Pirates claim their gains, and e indents to plunder more (though
    Last Week in Agora has not been able to confirm this intent was ever
    acted upon). Threads: 'Fine, I destroy "Combinotron"', "Doubloons",
    "Doubloon Redeption", "Another lost an dfound intent"

  * There's uncertainty about how much plunder each party gets for the
    last raid, and whether "I transfer all my doubloons" works given
    that uncertainty. Thread: "[Treasuror, Cuddlebeam] Doubloons". A CFJ
    is called (but withdrawn next week).


# Communication, website, and help for new players

Context: New player(s) have expressed recently that they have trouble
keeping up with what's going on, with all the email. An unofficial
Discord server was set up last week.

* Concerns are raised about Agora's unofficial Discord server being a
  proprietary platform, and there's discussion about possibly setting up
  an IRC bridge, or even a bridge to the MUD that Aris and Jason set up
  a while ago. Threads: "Put the discord on the agora home page", "Offer
  for those interested in creating a bridge"

* New player Zyborg asks how to deal with the email volume, and gets
  some advice. Thread: "How to keep up"

* The Webmastor adds a help section to the website:
  https://agoranomic.org/Help/ . Thread: "[Webmastor] Help pages now
  online."

* The Webmastor updates the website header. Thread: "[Webmaster] Header
  Changes"


# Proposals and regulations

* The Treasuror circulates draft auction regulations and gets comments.
  Threads: "[Treasuror] Draft Forward Auction Regulation(s)",
  "[Treasuror] Second draft of auction regulations"


# Fixes and other small changes

* Don't outlaw attempts at forbidden actions that aren't public. Thread:
  "DADA Weakening". Certified by the Referee on petition.


# Certification

Context: There's ongoing discussion about how and whether it should be
possible to pend certain proposals for free.

* ATMunn creates a proposal to repeal the "Certifiable Patches" rule,
  but says e is not in favour of it. Thread: "let's at least put it out
  there"

  * R. Lee certifies it, continuing eir streak of willfully illegal
    certification.


# Other rules questions

* What happens if a player dies? Thread: "is this too morbid?"; CFJ 3854


# Miscellaneous

* An old discussion about a minor anomaly or corruption in the mailing
  archives briefly resurfaces. Thread: "Archival disclosure"

* There's discussion about why a past Agoran economy had problems.
  Thread: "Why did PAoaM fail?"
