 # Summary

The stones are coming.
The darkness is going.
The factors are increasing.
The zombies are crumbling.
The labels are changing.
The karma is cycling.


# Voting

* Proposal 8523 is adopted, reducing the frequency of the Concentration
  Stone from once a week to once a month.

  * This Stone lets you grant your Focus to yourself, above and beyond
    each player's normal monthly grant.

  * Economy focus currently grants 183 coins per use (until someone
    besides Trigon selects it). With a weekly Concentration Stone, this
    could have created 700+ coins per month, which was deemed an
    excessive rate of inflation.

* Voting begins on Proposals 8524-8525:

  * 8524 would prevent using the Soul Stone to steal Stones owned by
    Agora, which would screw with auctions.

  * 8525 would expunge most of R. Lee's blots, leaving just enough to
    keep eir voting strength at 0.

    * These blots were self-awarded in June for a scam: R. Lee was
      repeatedly exiled, re-registered, received a Welcome Package and
      gave it to nch, stockpiling enough Victory Cards for mutual wins.

    * The Welcome Package rule was later amended to render such
      rapid-repeat Packages empty.


# Proposals

* Aris protoes a new version of eir attempt to clean up messaging
  standards. Thread: "DIS: [Draft Proposal] Sunlight is the Best
  Disinfectant"

  * Explicitly define the standards for dependent actions ("clear",
    "ambiguous", "conspicuous", "obfuscated"), plus "determinate" and
    "extricable".

  * Notices are defined and subjected to most of the same standards as
    dependent actions (ambiguity is not ruled out). Agoran decisions are
    resolved via Notices of Resolution.

  * The performer of an action is explicitly required to be reasonably
    clear. (Ironically, this clause is itself ambiguous; it was intended
    to cover the performer's identity.) Falsifian suggests regulating
    the sender's identity instead, with a hypothetical example where a
    person could do something either directly or via power of attorney
    (with same results otherwise).

  * Parts of a message may be documents, but no longer count as separate
    messages.

* Aris proto-protoes amending Rule 217 (Interpreting the Rules) to give
  judges more leeway. Thread: "DIS: On Rule 217 and the Four Factors:
  Another Proposal Prospectus"

  * E cites concern that all ambiguities are being judged based on a
    mere quantitative analysis of the "four factors" ("game custom,
    common sense, past judgements, and consideration of the best
    interests of the game"), rather than considering which factors (not
    necessarily limited to these four) should be given more weight in a
    specific case.

  * At least one specific version of such a proto has been shared and
    debated on the Discord server. Aris's original plan was to promote
    textualism (judging solely based on the text of the rules); later,
    e considered simply repealing the four factors, before settling on
    a "factors such as" approach.

  * G. recounts the history of the factors: originally "game custom and
    the spirit of the game" based on Suber's initial ruleset; "past
    judgements" added in 1995, "common sense" and "spirit -> best
    interests" in 1996.


# Rule questions

  * Should the four factors of Rule 217 (Interpreting the Rules) be used
    as a strict checklist? CFJ 3890 is assigned to Aris, who wants them
    not to be. Thread: "OFF: [Arbitor] CFJ 3890 Assigned to Aris (the
    ANCS approach)"


# Old players

* The phase-out of zombies proceeds apace.

  * Four are deregistered: Tyler, Zyborg, Fred, and Shelvacu. Thread:
    "[Registrar] Expedited export (attn. Shelvacu)"

  * Four more are put on the chopping block: D. Margaux, Baron von
    Vaderham, Talnaior, and sukil. Thread: "[Registrar] Second-last
    rites"

  * H. Registrar Falsifian points a finger at emself for not processing
    the first set on time, though questioning whether e was effectively
    required to. Thread: "[Finger Pointing] Re: Expedited export"

    * Do rules like "X SHALL perform all POSSIBLE actions Y after Z"
      include actions that only become POSSIBLE after Z, based on other
      actions under X's control?

    * H. Referee PSS says that the rules should be clarified, but rules
      in Falsifian's defense rather than set a troublesome precedent,
      inviting dissenters to CFJ.

  * Tiger, a player for much of 2009 through 2015, announces a change
    of legal name. Thread: "DIS: Name change"


# The economy

* The initial Stone auctions continue, with a delay agreed upon to let
  Proposal 8523 resolve first. Thread: "[Stonemason] Throwing Stones"

* H. Treasuror Trigon has been working on new automation to improve
  accuracy going forward. Thread: "@Treasuror RWO Asset Recovery"


# Meta

* Murphy takes the Agoran Press assignment, successfully this time,
  with Falsifian's cooperation. Thread: "[Agoran Press] Weekly
  Assignment (attn Murphy)"


# Miscellaneous

* Aris suggests repealing karma, which ironically leads to a chain of
  related karma awards. Threads: "DIS: Should We Save Honor?", "[Notice
  of Honour] Wait! Wait! I'm still using it!"

  * Falsifian buffs lucidiot (joining the Agoran Press) and dings Aris
    ("the Karma system's reaction to an existential threat").

  * ATMunn buffs Aris (Promotor) and dings Falsifian (disrespecting
    Promotor).

  * Cuddlebeam buffs Falsifian and dings lucidiot ("go full circle").

  * Lucidiot buffs Falsifian and dings Cuddlebeam (tit for tat).

  * PSS buffs Lucidiot (reinstating first award) and dings Cuddlebeam
    (dinging a new player).

* H. ADoP Murphy awards H. Herald, Referee, Tailor Publius Scribonius
  Scholasticus the Patent Title of Hard Labor. Thread: "Intent to award
  Patent Title [attn Herald]"
