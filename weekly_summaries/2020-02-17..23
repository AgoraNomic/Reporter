  Leaving the bourgeoisie"


# Voting

  elections, and issues a humiliating reminder to those who have not
  voted. More people vote. Thread: "[ADoP] Election voting opens"

* Voting begins on the elections for Prime Minister and Rulekeepor.
  Thread: "[ADoP] More elections"

* Alexis wins an uncontested Notary election after Gaelan forgots to

# Zombie auctions and trade

Some context: zombie auctions are broken. See CFJ 3793.

* Fixing zombie auctions (thread: "[proto] Fix zombie auctions"):

  * Falsifian attempts to fix eir zombie auction fix proposal. Thread
    includes discussion about regulated actions, and about the notion
    of "at will" in auctions.

  * Murphy proposes a simple fix.

* The Registrar, Falsifian, calls CFJs about the zombie auction
  relevent to eir report. First, whether the auction was initiated.
  (Thread: "[CFJ] Did I initiate a zombie auction?") Second, whether
  Jason's attempt to conditionally flip eir zombie's master to Agora if
  there was an auction succeeded. (Thread: "[CFJ] Re: BUS: Zombie
  cleanup (attn. Registrar)")

* Warrigal creates a contract allowing the effective trade of zombies.
  Thread: "Contract: the Zombie Market"


# Rules questions

* Various CFJs are judged (see Arbitor official reports).

  * Cuddle Beam finds that using Unicode characters that look like
    ASCII letters but in a different font is equivalent to just using
    those ASCII letters in a proposal title. This leads to some
    discussion. Thread: "CFJ 3815 judged TRUE (𝐸𝓃𝑔𝓁𝒾𝓈𝒽 𝒾𝓃 𝒶 𝒸𝑜𝑜𝓁 𝒻𝑜𝓃𝓉
    𝒾𝓈 𝓈𝓉𝒾𝓁𝓁 𝐸𝓃𝑔𝓁𝒾𝓈𝒽.)"

  * Gaelan publishes a draft judgement finding that Agora is not a contract,
    despite an earlier CFJ finding it was. This leads to much discussion.
    Thread: "CFJ 3813 proto-judged FALSE"

* A CFJ is called over the ability to perform by-announcement actions
  conditionally. Thread: "[Registrar] End of February zombie auction"

* G. asks a question about regulated actions, possibly it is relevant
  to eir job of judging CFJ 3817 (about zombie auctions). Alexis points
  out eir judgement of CFJ 3793 (also about zombie auctions) has the
  answer. Warrigal hypothesizes a situation where a rule said "When
  this rule is enacted, a player is deregistered." without saying whom.


# Proposals

(See also: attempts to fix zombie auctions in the "Zombie auctions and
trade" section in this document.)

* Falsifian drafts a proposal describing a new office responsible for
  maintaining a FAQ and helping new players. Thread: "reply-to headers
  always pointing to this list"

* Falsifian responds to comments on eir "Retroactive Events"
  proto-proposal. Thread: "[proto] Retroactive Events: a refactor of
  ratification"

* Jason works on a proposal to make the recent securing of Ribbon
  Ownership not apply to Black Ribbons, since some people commented
  that Black Ribbons should remain targets of scams of any power.
  Thread: "[proposal] De-secure Black Ribbons"

* Based on a question of whether rules need to explicitly state methods
  when they perform actions (threads: "[proto] Fix zombie auctions" and
  "[proposal] De-secure Black Ribbons"), Jason proposes to increase the
  power of Rule 2141 (thread: "[Proposal] Rules are important").


# Miscellaneous

* The Arbitor calls for judges to help with a high caseload, and
  receives volunteers. Thread: "[Arbitor] State of the Bench"

* Gaelan suggests using CC or BCC as a way to notify officers instead
  of putting [Attn: (office)] in the subject line. Thread: "RFC: Cc/Bcc
  as a mechanism to notify officers"

* Alexis publishes a Rule 2557 apology. Thread: "An apology"

* Aris petitions the Herald to conduct peer review on eir thesis, "The
  Very Worst Thing That Could Possibly Happen". Thread: "The Very Worst
  Thing That Could Possibly Happen (Attn. Distributor)"
