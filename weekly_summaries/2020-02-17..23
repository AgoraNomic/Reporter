# Victory

* Jason joins the club by paying 1,000 Coins to win. Thread: "[DoV]
  Leaving the bourgeoisie"


# Zombie auctions and trade

Some context: zombie auctions are broken. See CFJ 3793.

* Falsifian attempts to fix eir zombie auction fix proposal. Thread
  includes discussion about regulated actions, and about the notion of
  "at will" in auctions. Thread: "[proto] Fix zombie auctions"

* The Registrar, Falsifian, calls CFJs about the zombie auction
  relevent to eir report. First, whether the auction was initiated.
  (Thread: "[CFJ] Did I initiate a zombie auction?") Second, whether
  Jason's attempt to conditionally flip eir zombie's master to Agora if
  there was an auction succeeded. (Thread: "[CFJ] Re: BUS: Zombie
  cleanup (attn. Registrar)")

* Warrigal creates a contract allowing the effective trade of zombies.
  Thread: "Contract: the Zombie Market"


# Miscellaneous

* Falsifian drafts a proposal describing a new office responsible for
  maintaining a FAQ and helping new players. Thread: "reply-to headers
  always pointing to this list"

* Falsifian responds to comments on eir "Retroactive Events"
  proto-proposal. Thread: "[proto] Retroactive Events: a refactor of
  ratification"

* Jason works on a proposal to make the recent securing of Ribbon
  Ownership not apply to Black Ribbons, since some people commented
  that Black Ribbons should remain targets of scams of any power.
  Thread: "[proposal] De-secure Black Ribbons"

* The Arbitor calls for judges to help with a high caseload, and
  receives volunteers. Thread: "[Arbitor] State of the Bench"

* Various CFJs are judged (see Arbitor official reports).

  * Cuddle Beam finds that using Unicode characters that look like
    ASCII letters but in a different font is equivalent to just using
    those ASCII letters in a proposal title. This leads to some
    discussion. Thread: "CFJ 3815 judged TRUE (𝐸𝓃𝑔𝓁𝒾𝓈𝒽 𝒾𝓃 𝒶 𝒸𝑜𝑜𝓁 𝒻𝑜𝓃𝓉
    𝒾𝓈 𝓈𝓉𝒾𝓁𝓁 𝐸𝓃𝑔𝓁𝒾𝓈𝒽.)"

* Based on a question of whether rules need to explicitly state methods
  when they perform actions (threads: "[proto] Fix zombie auctions" and
  "[proposal] De-secure Black Ribbons"), Jason proposes to increase the
  power of Rule 2141 (thread: "[Proposal] Rules are important").

* Gaelan suggests using CC or BCC as a way to notify officers instead
  of putting [Attn: (office)] in the subject line. Thread: "RFC: Cc/Bcc
  as a mechanism to notify officers"
