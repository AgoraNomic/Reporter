# Summary

Welcome, Nathan (for the proper week, this time), and Happy Birthday!

Some comics by Cuddlebeam: https://imgur.com/a/VDAQaae

Agreements and rules are easier to follow if you know what they say.
This week, Agorans studied contracts with hard-to-figure-out provisions,
and Gaelan drafted a tournament centred on hidden rule changes.

Our first Rulebending CFJ was judged this week, and G. (effectively our
Emperor of Rulebending) offers to let people try out Rulebending, for a
fee, as long as it's not out of control.

In other news, our first zombie auction under the simplified R2545 ended
this week, and your Agoran Press is officially funded.


# Voting

* Voting begins on Proposals 8490-8492, all of which are (or purport to
  be) fixes.


# New players

* New player Nathan registers. (This was accidentally reported for the
  previous week.) E raises the same question about birthdays that our
  second-newest player Shelvacu did the week before last. Threads:
  "Joining Agora", "Question About Agoran Birthdays", "Birthday"


# Culture

* Cuddlebeam makes comics, and submits them as a thesis. Threads:
  "humble agoran comic", "Peer Review of Cuddlebeam's Visual
  Submissions"

# Scams, rule questions, etc.

* Can a Rulebending Form escape its limitations by explicitly taking
  precedence over the rule that limits it? No: Gaelan judges CFJ 3874
  FALSE.

* Contract provisions:

    * Are hard-to-compute contract provisions effective? No: G. judges
      CFJ 3875 FALSE, and sets a standard in eir judgement.

    * What if a provision refers to the hash of a "previously published"
      document, when it's not obvious which document? G. sets up an
      experiment, Jason triggers it, and the Referee finds a
      finger-pointing related to such a provision doesn't meet R2531's
      "preponderance of the evidence" requirement. Thread: "But I Won't
      Do That"

* Discussion continues on whether offial reports with caveats
  self-ratify in the thread "Forbes 486".


# Zombie auction

The August zombie auction, which is the first zombie auction under the
newly simplified Rule 2545, ended this week.

* Gaelan starts a coalition to bid for D. Margaux, the zombie with the
  most coins. Thread: "Contract: Let's snag D. Margaux"

  * The Registrar warns that the player bidding on behalf of the
    coalition must own as many coins as e bid. (It's unclear when the
    requirement is evaluated.)

  * The coalition does not result in a bid on a zombie.

* G. discovers that the new "talismans" zombie rules no longer allow a
  zombie master to return the zombie to Agora. Thread: "Zombie
  auction"


# Miscellaneous

* G. offers to temporarily make people Rulebending Magisters for a fee,
  if e doesn't think their ideas will break the game. Thread:
  "Rulebending Academy"

* Gaelan proposes a Nomic tournament where proposal texts are secret.
  Thread: "Proto-tournament: Nomaoic"

* The Agoran Press becomes the first publicly funded contract under Rule
  2631. Thread: "Donation Level Petition"
