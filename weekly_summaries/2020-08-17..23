Status: Covers the whole week, but still needs a summary.


# Voting

* Voting begins on Proposals 8490-8492, all of which are (or purport to be)
  fixes.


# New players

* New player Nathan registers. (This was accidentally reported for the previous
  week.)


# Culture

* Cuddlebeam makes comics, and submits them as a thesis. Threads:
  "humble agoran comic", "Peer Review of Cuddlebeam's Visual
  Submissions"


# Scams, rule questions, etc.

* Can a Rulebending Form escape its limitations by explicitly taking precedence
  over the rule that limits it? No: Gaelan judges CFJ 3874 FALSE.

* Contract provisions:

    * Are hard-to-compute contract provisions effective? No: G. judges
      CFJ 3875 FALSE, and sets a standard in eir judgement.

    * What if a provision refers to the hash of a "previously published"
      document, when it's not obvious which document? G. sets up an
      experiment, Jason triggers it, and the Referee finds a
      finger-pointing related to such a provision doesn't meet R2531's
      "preponderance of the evidence" requirement. Thread: "But I Won't
      Do That"

* Our newest player Nathan raises the same question about birthdays that
  our second-newest player Shelvacu did the week before last. Threads:
  "Question About Agoran Birthdays", "Birthday"

* Discussion continues on whether offial reports with caveats self-ratify in
  the thread "Forbes 486".


# Miscellaneous

* G. offers to temporarily make people Rulebending Magisters for a fee, if e
  doesn't think their ideas will break the game. Thread: "Rulebending Academy"

* In the ongoing zombie auction, Gaelan starts a coalition to bid for
  D. Margaux, the zombie with the most coins. Thread: "Contract: Let's
  snag D. Margaux"

  * The Registrar warns that the player bidding on behalf of the
    coalition must own as many coins as e bid. (It's unclear when the
    requirement is evaluated.)

* Gaelan proposes a Nomic tournament where proposal texts are secret. Thread:
  "Proto-tournament: Nomaoic"

* The Agoran Press becomes the first publicly funded contract under Rule 2631.
  Thread: "Donation Level Petition"

* The August zombie auction, which is the first zombie auction under the newly
  simplified Rule 2545, ends.

  * G. discovers that the new "talismans" zombie rules no longer allow a zombie
    master to return the zombie to Agora. Thread: "Zombie auction"
