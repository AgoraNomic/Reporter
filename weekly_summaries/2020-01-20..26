# Voting

* The H. Assessor resolves Proposals 8280-8286. Proposals 8281 and 8283
  are adopted. The first is an attempt by Gaelan to outsmart Rule 1030
  and grant emself a patent title with a power-0.1 rule. The second, by
  Alexis, is a change to the rule text about earning a Red ribbon.

  * Alexis CoEs the resolution message, on the basis that it does not
    record several of eir votes as endorsements. Jason Cobb denies the
    CoE on the grounds that this is what e normally does and others
    haven't complained.

* Voting begins on Proposals 8287-8307. This is a long list of
  proposals, some of which would make significant changes.


# Culture

* twg submits a thesis titled "Letter to an Anti-Scamster: On the
  Importance of Loopholes in Agoran Culture" in the form of a detailed
  message declining Aris's request that e promise eir proposals contain
  no scams, and detailed reasoning about why e feels that "warranties
  against scams and loopholes should not be given on a blanket basis".
  Thread: "Warranty"

  * There is a side discussion about what should qualify for a J.N.
    degree.

  * G. proposes to award twg a new patent title, "Orator", based on
    twg's thesis, and receives support. Thread: "[Herald] Hear, hear!"

* Gaelan's Proposal 8280 having passed, e attempts to award emself the
  patent title "The Powerless", and calls a CFJ about whether it
  worked. Thread: "[Assessor] Resolution of Proposals 8280-8286".

  Thread: "[Proposal] Gender neutrality in degrees".

* Falsifian identifies a possible bug in twg's proposal 8291, and
  submits a proposal in an attempt to fix it. Thread: "[Promotor]
  Distribution of Proposals 8287-8307".


# Rules questions

* G. publishes some follow-up research on eir CFJ 3792, about whether
  Aris published a valid Promotor's report. E missed the time window to
  file a motion to reconsider to include it in eir judgement.

* Jason Cobb calls a CFJ: "Coming into existence is a regulated
  action". E earlier (in September) called CFJ 3772, "Existing is a
  regulated action".

* Discussion continues on messages that are only forwarded to the forum
  some time after they were originally sent. Thread: "Apathy".

  Vaderham for being inactive. G. objects, and D. Margaux responds by

  Player cleanup".

* Jason Cobb notes that no tournament has been initiated for three
  months (with the Birthday Tournament in mind), and repeals tournament
  regulations. Thread: "Tournament Cleanup".
