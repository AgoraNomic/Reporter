# Voting

* The H. Assessor resolves Proposals 8280-8286. Proposals 8281 and 8283
  are adopted. The first is an attempt by Gaelan to outsmart Rule 1030
  and grant emself a patent title with a power-0.1 rule. The second, by
  Alexis, is a change to the rule text about earning a Red ribbon.

  * Alexis CoEs the resolution message, on the basis that it does not
    record several of eir votes as endorsements. Jason Cobb denies the
    CoE on the grounds that this is what e normally does and others
    haven't complained.

* Voting begins on Proposals 8287-8307. This is a long list of
  proposals, some of which would make significant changes.


# Culture

* twg submits a thesis titled "Letter to an Anti-Scamster: On the
  Importance of Loopholes in Agoran Culture" in the form of a detailed
  message declining Aris's request that e promise eir proposals contain
  no scams, and detailed reasoning about why e feels that "warranties
  against scams and loopholes should not be given on a blanket basis".
  Thread: "Warranty"

  * There is a side discussion about what should qualify for a J.N.
    degree.

  * G. proposes to award twg a new patent title, "Orator", based on
    twg's thesis, and receives support. Thread: "[Herald] Hear, hear!"

* Gaelan's Proposal 8280 having passed, e attempts to award emself the
  patent title "The Powerless", and calls a CFJ about whether it
  worked. Thread: "[Assessor] Resolution of Proposals 8280-8286".


# Proposals

* Alexis proposes renaming of degrees to make them gender-neutral.
  Thread: "[Proposal] Gender neutrality in degrees".

* Falsifian identifies a possible bug in twg's proposal 8291, and
  submits a proposal in an attempt to fix it. Thread: "[Promotor]
  Distribution of Proposals 8287-8307".

* Alexis proposes to amend Rule 2595 to allow the initiator of a
  dependent action to withdraw their announcement of intent, leading to
  discussion of whether the change works as intended, whether it is a
  good idea, other thoughts about dependent actions, and at least one
  sketch of an alternative proposal. Thread: "[Proposal] A degree of
  inefficiency"

  * In the same thread,Gaelan recalls a scam of eirs that turned on the
    way Rule 2595 was written at the time.

  * A side note in the discussion is that a range of CFJs is missing
    from G.'s CFJ archive.


# Rules questions

* G. publishes some follow-up research on eir CFJ 3792, about whether
  Aris published a valid Promotor's report. E missed the time window to
  file a motion to reconsider to include it in eir judgement.

* Jason Cobb calls a CFJ: "Coming into existence is a regulated
  action". E earlier (in September) called CFJ 3772, "Existing is a
  regulated action".

* Discussion continues on messages that are only forwarded to the forum
  some time after they were originally sent. G. and Aris describe some
  historical precedent. Thread: "Apathy"

* H. Judge omd finds CFJ 3786, which is about whether a proposal was
  distributed, TRUE based on a ratification event that happened after
  the CFJ was called. There follows a discussion on whether the CFJ
  should be reconsidered based on some text in Rule 591. Thread:
  "[Arbitor] CFJ 3786 Assigned to omd"


# Miscellaneous

* Gaelan submits a proposal to deregister D. Margaux and Baron von
  Vaderham for being inactive. G. objects, and D. Margaux responds by
  submitting a proposal to deregister Gaelan. Thread: "[Proposal]
  Player cleanup".

* Jason Cobb notes that no tournament has been initiated for three
  months (with the Birthday Tournament in mind), and repeals tournament
  regulations. Thread: "Tournament Cleanup".

* Falsifian resigns as Treasuror, as e had earlier announced e might
  do. Thread: "[attn: ADoP] Whither the Agoran economy?"


# Mailing list troubles

For context, see the 2020-12-16..23 through 2020-01-06..12 weekly
summaries.

* H. Judge and Distributor omd judges CFJ 3787, finding that a message
  sent during a recent period of mailing list trouble was in fact not a
  public message.
