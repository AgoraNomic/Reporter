# Mailing list trouble

* For unknown technical reasons, some list subscribers stopped
  receiving messages from the list at some point during this week.
  Thread: "Message Test".


# Rules questions

* Falsifian judges CFJs 3780 and 3782, about whether a person who
  publishes an action as part of quoted text performs that action.

* G. submits a proposal with text beginning "I transfer 5 coins to each
  active player...", leading to some discussion about what the proposal
  would do if enacted. Thread: "I'm curious if this version works".


# Miscellaneous

* Ã˜rjan solves a minor mistory about formatting issues with a ruleset
  recently published by Jason Cobb: it was related to "format=flowed"
  in the Content-Type header. (Thread: "[deputy-Rulekeepor] Short
  Logical Ruleset".)
