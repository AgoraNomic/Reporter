# Voting

(See also Proposals 8484 and 8495 under "G.'s rulebending scam".)

* Proposals 8488 and 8489 are adopted.

  * 8488 generalizes a fix to the fee-based actions rule.

  * 8489 associates "the type of card with the fewest existing
    instances" with the Ministry of Economy.


# G.'s rulebending scam

* The decisions to adopt Proposals 8484 and 8495 are resolved as FAILED
  QUORUM.

  * These would have repealed the Rulebending rule G. used to grab
    power. G. blocked them last week by demonstrating a "rulebending
    form" that withdrew all votes and ended the voting period.

  * G. re-issues eir rulebending form (thread: "so as not to keep people
    up until midnight") and the Assessor re-assesses the proposals,
    probably because the voting period may have been extended.

* Gaelan pledges to punish G.'s unwitting enablers with negative karma.

# Rule questions

* Related to Aris's "Proofs of Claim" contract:

  * When Aris's contract says any player CAN "file a proof of claim of a
    valid judgement" with notice, does that mean anyone can do that just
    by saying e does that? No: Murphy judges CFJ 3881 FALSE, saying e
    actually needs to provide some sort of proof.

  * Can G. file a proof of claim if e actually provides proof? Yes:
    Murphy judges CFJ 3882 TRUE.
