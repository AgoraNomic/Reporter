# Summary

This week, a feeble attempt by traiterous rebels to unseat our rightful
Emperor G. (Proposals 8484 and 8485) was confirmed failed, easily
brushed aside by Eir Greatness, for whose benevolent leadership we are
grateful.

The week was relatively quiet. A couple of minor proposals were adopted,
and as usual, strange and pedantic questions were discussed. New auction
methods are being used: a second-price zombie auction concludes, and a
sealed-bid victory auction begins.


# Voting

(See also Proposals 8484 and 8495 under "G.'s rulebending scam".)

* The decisions to adopt proposals 8488 and 8489 are resolved: both are
  adopted.

  * 8488 generalizes a fix to the fee-based actions rule.

  * 8489 associates "the type of card with the fewest existing
    instances" with the Ministry of Economy.

* The decisions to adopt Proposals 8495 and 8497 are resolved: both are
  rejected. (8496 probably wasn't distributed.)

  * (Note added later: There were two Proposals 8495; as of 2020-09-15,
    the Promotor plans to renumber the one covered by this item to
    8499.)


# G.'s rulebending scam

* The decisions to adopt Proposals 8484 and 8495 are resolved as FAILED
  QUORUM, confirming that G. has successfully established a power-3
  dictatorship.

  * (Note added later: There were two Proposals 8495; as of 2020-09-15,
    the Promotor plans to renumber the one covered by this item to
    8498.)

  * These would have repealed the Rulebending rule G. used to grab
    power. G. blocked them last week by demonstrating a "rulebending
    form" that withdrew all votes and ended the voting period.

  * G. re-issues eir rulebending form (thread: "so as not to keep people
    up until midnight") and the Assessor re-assesses the proposals,
    probably because the voting period may have been extended.

* Gaelan pledges to punish G.'s unwitting enablers with negative karma.

# Rule questions

* Related to Aris's "Proofs of Claim" contract:

  * When Aris's contract says any player CAN "file a proof of claim of a
    valid judgement" with notice, does that mean anyone can do that just
    by saying e does that? No: Murphy judges CFJ 3881 FALSE, saying e
    actually needs to provide some sort of proof.

  * Can G. file a proof of claim if e actually provides proof? Yes:
    Murphy judges CFJ 3882 TRUE.

* The Registrar is persuaded that the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment is
  indeed a forum. Thread: "to the moooooon [Emergency]"; CFJ 3884


# Auctions

* The Treasuror begins a Victory Auction, using eir sealed-bid auction
  method this time.

* The September zombie auction (a second-price auction this time) ends.


# Miscellaneous

* Various Apathy intents with different sets of players, and objections
  thereto, are announced (some to the backup list, for some reason).
  Threads: "Intense In Tents", (No Subject)

* The mystery of who published newspaper headlines during the Diplonomic
  game deepens, with G. revealing it wasn't em (as part of a colourful
  formal apology). Thread: "Gesticulation"

* Gaelan explains how some messages from Discord are archived to the
  discussion list. Thread: "Discord digest 2020-09-06"

* Our Promotor enacts administrative regulations relevant to eir office,
  which give guidance on submitting proposals and on when to support
  pending proposals for free. Thread: "[Promotor] Administrative
  Regulations"
