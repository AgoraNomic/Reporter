# Notable events

* Jason Cobb takes over the office of Rulekeepor by deputising to
  publish the first Short Logical Ruleset (SLR) since October 15.

  * There is some discussion of the formatting, which may have been messed up.

  * Jason Cobb indicates e doesn't intend to keep the office, and
    publishes contract text allowing another player to take over the
    office from em. Thread: "BUS: Housekeeping (contains proposal)".

  * Jason Cobb proposes to ratify the SLR e just published, but others
    say it is better to wait a while before ratifying a ruleset.
    Thread: "BUS: Housekeeping (contains proposal)".

* Jason Cobb possibly earns 18000 Coins through a scam involving three
  recent rule changes: Emerald ribbons (for winning an election),
  "Glitter" (allows a player to earn Coins for re-earning a ribbon),
  and Jason Cobb's Proposal 8276, which ensured that someone can win
  the same election multiple times. Thread: "BUS: [Assessor] Election".

  * CFJ 3783 addresses whether this succeeded. G. submits an argument
    against it, because "a scam's no fun if there's not a defense".

  * This leads to some discussion of doing a "currency reevaluation",
    for example by reducing everyone's coin balance to at most 500.

* The Prime Minister election enters the voting period.


# Rule questions

* In a similar vein to twg's campaign speech "CFJ: I am a candidate for
  Prime Minister.", G. publishes a proposal containing an action in its
  text, and calls a CFJ about whether the action took effect. Thread:
  "BUS: proposal sorta paradox thing".

* G. submits an argument on CFJ 3779 (on whether sending "And my axe!"
  caused twg to become a candidate for Prime Minister) and reassigns it
  to Jason Cobb (probably because Murphy took too long). Jason Cobb
  judges it FALSE.


# Miscellaneous

* Zombie ATMunn comes back to life, and to mark the occasion submits a
  proposal that some hidden text takes effect unless someone can guess
  it by its hash. The proposal is negatively received and e withdraws
  it. Thread: "BUS: The dead rises again".
